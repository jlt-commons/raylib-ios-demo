  "Vampire Survivors, steered with a thumb-stick. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `vampire-survivors` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `vampire_survivors`).

  The original moves with WASD or the arrows and restarts with ENTER. Here the
  hero follows a relative thumb-stick: wherever a finger lands is the stick's
  centre, and while it stays down the vector from that point to the finger is the
  direction. Inside `gesture/slop` of the centre there is no direction, so a tap
  or a trembling finger never moves the hero. Outside it the hero goes that way
  at the original's one fixed speed, the vector normalised so a diagonal is no
  faster, as the original's digital keys give a fixed step. `stick-dir` is that
  rule as a pure function. A press under `gesture/back-region` belongs to the
  host and starts no stick. A tap on the field restarts after game over, with
  idle stored on the frame the hero dies, unless that frame is a press, so a
  finger already down when the hero dies cannot restart on its lift.

  The rules are the original's: waves of two enemies plus one per 600 frames
  every 50 frames, shortening by one per 120 frames to a floor of 12, a 30 frame
  head start, enemies that chase at a fixed speed and die to two bullets, a
  shot every 22 frames less two per level to a floor of 5, bullets that live 90
  frames, a gem for every kill, a pickup radius of 44, levelling at five gems
  per level, 8 damage on contact with 25 frames of grace and 100 HP.

  This is frame-locked, like the original, which never reads a frame time:
  `advance` moves everything a fixed distance per call. The 800x450 game is
  scaled into the play field below `gesture/back-region` by one factor `:u`, the
  geometric mean of the two axes' scales, which applies to every radius and
  speed because the motion is free in two dimensions. Enemies appear on the edge
  of the field, one radius inside it, where the original starts them 20 pixels
  outside, and never within touching distance of the hero. Outside the field
  they would be drawn over the Back button. A rotation starts a new game,
  since every position is in the old screen's pixels.

  The counts are bounded through frame 720 (about 12 s). Bullets live 90 frames
  and a shot takes at least 5, so at most 18 are alive. A gem needs a kill and a
  kill needs an enemy, so enemies and gems together never exceed what the waves
  have spawned, which by frame 720 is 16 waves of at most 3, so 48. Waves grow
  with time, so later the bound is higher.

  Randomness comes from the project's LCG, taking its high bits. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors. The draw method packs them with `rl/rgba`."
