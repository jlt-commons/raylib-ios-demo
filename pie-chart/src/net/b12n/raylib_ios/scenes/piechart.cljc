(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.piechart
  "A rotating pie chart, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `pie-chart` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `pie_chart`).

  The second scene here that fills rather than outlines, and it uses the same
  rlgl triangle fan the colour wheel does. raylib-jlt reaches for its `sector!`
  helper; there is no such helper here, so a slice is built from the same
  primitive: a run of triangles from the centre out to the arc, enough of them
  that the arc reads as curved.

  Segment count is per slice and proportional to its angle, so a thin slice does
  not get the same twenty triangles a fat one does. That is the difference
  between 300 triangles a frame and 100 for an identical picture.

  The whole chart turns, which is the original's idea and a good one: a static
  pie chart hides the fact that the eye judges these by angle rather than area,
  and a rotating one makes that obvious."
