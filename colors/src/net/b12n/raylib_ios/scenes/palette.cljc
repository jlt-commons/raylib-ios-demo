(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.palette
  "Every colour raylib names, as a labelled grid. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `colors` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `colors`), which is itself a showcase rather than a port of one C example.

  The values are raylib's own, transcribed from `raylib.h` by way of
  raylib-jlt's `raylib.clj`, and they are held here as data rather than as
  twenty-five more constants in `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host`. The host defines the five it
  actually uses. A scene that wants to draw the palette wants a sequence it can
  iterate, not twenty-five vars it would have to list again by hand.

  Worth knowing what this exercises: every swatch is a separate packed Color
  crossing the FFI, so a grid of twenty-five is a cheap check that the packing
  is right across the whole range rather than for the handful a typical scene
  touches. BLANK is deliberately absent, since a fully transparent swatch would
  draw nothing and read as a bug."

  Rec. 601 luma, because green carries far more perceived brightness than blue
  does and a flat channel average pretends otherwise. Two colours in this very
  palette come out on opposite sides of the two measures:

    ORANGE  255 161 0    flat 139 (dark)   luma 171 (light)
    MAGENTA 255 0 255    flat 170 (light)  luma 105 (dark)

  Both times luma matches what the eye does, so a flat average would put light
  ink on orange and dark ink on magenta, and both labels would struggle."
