  "Six balls bouncing inside a box under gravity, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `bouncing-spheres` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `bouncing_spheres`) (zlib licence). The projection is in software, by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original (bouncing_spheres.clj) keeps six spheres (`spawn`, lines 15-25),
  each at x and z `GetRandomValue(-30, 30) / 10` and y `GetRandomValue(10, 40) /
  10`, with vx and vz `GetRandomValue(-10, 10) / 100`, vy 0, radius
  `GetRandomValue(3, 6) / 10` and the colour `palette` gives it (line 13: RED,
  ORANGE, GREEN, SKYBLUE, VIOLET, GOLD). The draws run in the map's order: x, y,
  z, vx, vz, r. Here `GetRandomValue` is the project's LCG seeded with 20261002,
  taking its high bits (`(mod (quot seed' 65536) (inc (- hi lo)))` plus lo), so
  the first six are the same every run and a respawn goes on from where the LCG
  stopped.

  `step` (lines 33-40) runs once a frame, with no frame time, like the
  original: gravity 0.01 comes off vy, then each axis moves by its velocity and
  `reflect` (lines 27-31) bounces it. A sphere whose near side `p - r` is
  below -4 is put at `-4 + r` and its velocity is reversed and scaled by the
  restitution 0.9. A far side `p + r` above 4 is put at `4 - r` the same way.
  The camera (lines 55-57) is at (10, 8, 10) looking at the origin, fovy 45, up
  (0, 1, 0), and a `DrawGrid(10, 1)` lies on the floor. The original has no
  walls of the box, only the bounce.

  Controls: SPACE respawns all six (line 52). Here a tap anywhere outside Back
  does, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture/track`: a tap is a finger that lifts without
  travelling past the slop. The release position is never read. Nothing else is
  read, as the original reads nothing else. The on-screen text becomes \"Spheres
  bouncing in a 3D box - tap respawns\".

  The spheres are the original's `rl/sphere!`, which is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/sphere`.
  The original tessellates each at 10 rings by 14 slices, 140 quads, 280
  triangles, 122 of which face the camera for a ball at the origin. This scene
  draws 6 rings by 8 slices, 48 quads, because the original's tessellation
  built in 0.89 ms a frame under jolt on the laptop, and a scene is sized to
  about 0.30 ms there (the performance guide's \"Sizing a scene on the laptop\":
  a build is about 33 times slower on the phone). 6 by 8 builds in about 0.39 ms
  with about 240 triangles facing the camera, which is inside the edge of that
  rule and held 60 fps on the phone. The sphere count, the radii and
  the physics are the original's. The grid goes in first, then the balls in
  groups, far to near by the distance of each group's mean centre from the eye.
  A ball whose sphere touches no other
  (centres nearer than the sum of the radii, taken transitively) is a group of
  one and goes in whole, and `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` is not called for it (sorting
  every triangle cost more than the phone's budget). The triangles of a group of
  two or more are sorted together by `finish`, because the original has no
  collision between balls and they interpenetrate in about 4 frames in 9 once
  they have settled (measured, 322 of 720 sampled poses with a touching pair).
  Whole-ball order paints a small ball over a big one it is half inside, wrongly,
  so those triangles are depth sorted. What stays is the depth sort's own limit:
  a triangle is ordered by its mean depth, so a residue at the lens where two
  balls cross can remain. A lone ball whose depth falls between the members of a
  group can also paint over the nearer member (5 of 12,000 simulated poses).
  The grid is drawn first, so a line under a ball is
  lost, as it is meant to be. Every ball stays in the box, which the camera
  sees, so none is culled, though one at the near floor corner reaches past the
  field's edge and is clipped by the draw method's scissor.

  The state holds the balls (maps of numbers), the LCG seed, the gesture and
  `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
