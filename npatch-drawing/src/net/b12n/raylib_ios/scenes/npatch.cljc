  "Npatch Drawing, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `npatch-drawing` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `npatch_drawing`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/npatch_drawing.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_npatch_drawing`: three panels stretched by the pointer, a nine-patch
  that grows in both axes and two three-patches that grow in one. The corners
  stay the size they were drawn at while the edges and the middle take up the
  slack.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  The original has no npatch helper in its library. `npatch!` (lines 49-83) is
  written out in the example itself, nine quads whose source rectangles carve
  the image into a 3x3, and `cells` here is that arithmetic.

  Mirrored from npatch_drawing.clj:
  - The source (lines 31-47): 64 by 64 (line 28), a border of 16 (line 29),
    corner studs where `edge` is between 5 and 8, and the four bands of colour
    by `edge`, as `patch-colour`. It is clamped and unfiltered (lines 98-99).
  - `cells` (lines 49-83): destination spans `xs`/`ws`/`ys`/`hs` with the middle
    taking what is left over, the source split `us`/`vs`, and a cell with no
    width or height skipped.
  - The panels (lines 116-131): a nine-patch at (380, 150), a horizontal
    three-patch 48 high at (60, 100) with no top or bottom, a vertical one 48
    wide at (60, 150) with no left or right. Their sizes follow the pointer
    (lines 110-113), `px - 380` held to 40..360, `py - 150` to 40..250, `px - 60`
    to 40..280 and `py - 150` to 40..250.
  - The idle pointer (lines 104-109): until it moves, it breathes,
    `420 + 180 sin t` and `260 + 120 sin 1.3t` with `t = frame * 0.02`.
  - The text (lines 132-155 and 160-163) and the source drawn at its own size in
    the bottom-right corner (lines 156-159).

  Deviations. The mouse is a finger: a drag over the screen is the pointer, and
  it stays where the finger left. The panels are laid out on the original's
  800-wide canvas, scaled to the screen and put under the text; the pointer is
  carried into that canvas, so the original's sums hold in its own units. The
  scale is the screen's, so the corners are 16 texels at the source's size times
  that scale. Update runs before draw, so the first drawn frame is frame 1.

  The state holds `:frame`, `:touch` (the last place a finger was, in canvas
  units, or nil) and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
