  "A static tour of the basic shapes: a filled and an outlined rectangle, a
  filled and an outlined circle, an ellipse, a line and a triangle. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `shapes` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `shapes`), itself raylib's `shapes_basic_shapes`. It is the
  side-by-side of the plain primitives, where `rounded`, `ring`, `sector` and
  `rlgltriangle` each animate one of them in depth and `outlines` studies a
  stroke's thickness. Nothing moves and nothing is read, so there is no input
  handling to get wrong.

  Two of the original's calls are not bound here and are rebuilt. The ellipse is
  a triangle fan, which is the example: `ellipse-fan` returns wedges from the
  centre to consecutive rim points, and the draw method hands each to
  `rl/draw-triangle`, which fixes its own winding. The wedges are wound
  negative-cross natively too, so a culled one would show in a test as well as
  as a pie-slice hole on the phone. The segment count is `ellipse-segments`: the
  fewest chords that keep every one within half a pixel of the curve, which is
  `ceil(pi / acos(1 - 0.5 / r))` for the larger radius `r`, floored at 12 so a
  tiny ellipse is still round and capped at 180 so a huge one costs a bounded
  number of triangles.

  The rectangle outline is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.outlines/rect-lines`, four lines that
  grow inward from the rectangle's own edge, as `DrawRectangleLines` does. The
  circle outline is `rl/draw-ring` rather than the bound `rl/draw-circle-lines`,
  because that is a one pixel line, which is hard to see on a phone. The ring
  keeps the circle's outer edge and grows inward by `thick`. The original's
  line is also a hairline and is `thick` wide here, for the same reason. The
  triangle is the original's, drawn with `rl/draw-triangle` where the original
  used rlgl immediate mode by hand.

  The original is laid out for 800 by 450. This is laid out for portrait, five
  bands one above another: two rectangles, two circles, the ellipse, the line
  and the triangle. A scale `f`, in pixels per original pixel, is the smaller of
  a 300th of the width and a 130th of a band's height, so the pairs fit across
  and every shape fits in its band. On a landscape screen it is small, and
  that is accepted. The title is below `gesture/back-region`."
