  "Magnifying Glass, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `magnifying-glass` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `magnifying_glass`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/magnifying_glass.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_magnifying_glass` (zlib). This is an altered version of both.

  A round lens follows your finger and shows the scene at 3x. Five markers are
  drawn only into the lens, so there are things in the scene that cannot be
  found without moving the glass over them. The scene is drawn twice: once at
  its own size to the screen, and once magnified into a small render target
  whose middle is the point under the finger. The target is then drawn back as a
  disc, a fan of textured triangles, under a black ring.

  Mirrored from magnifying_glass.clj:
  - The constants (lines 31-35): `lens` 220, `zoom` 3.0 and `segments` 64, with
    the original's 800 by 450 as `window-w` and `window-h`.
  - The hidden markers (lines 38-39): `hidden-spots`, five of them, drawn only on
    the magnified pass, each a LIME circle of radius 11 with a DARKGREEN one of
    radius 6 on it.
  - The scene (lines 41-72): the Perlin backdrop stretched over the window, then
    seven squares of side 56 at x = 60 + 100 i, y = 90, coloured
    (40 + 25 i, 90, 210 - 20 i), each with a circle of radius 22 at
    (x + 28, 300) coloured (230, 60 + 20 i, 70).
  - The lens (lines 74-97, 126-150): the disc of `segments` wedges whose texcoords
    come off the unit circle, with v flipped because a render target is stored
    bottom-up, and a BLACK ring 4 thick on its rim. The magnified pass moves the
    scene so the point under the finger lands in the middle of the target:
    ox = half - x * zoom.
  - The texts (lines 151-157): \"five markers are drawn only inside the lens\"
    once the lens has been moved, \"move the pointer to take over the lens\"
    before, in size 18 BLACK at (20, 16).
  - The idle lens (lines 117-125): until the pointer moves, the lens walks its own
    path, (W/2 + 250 sin t, H/2 + 120 sin 1.7 t) with t = 0.02 a frame.

  The backdrop is raylib's own Perlin image, 800 by 450, offsets 0, scale 6.0,
  made in C by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.texture/perlin-texture!`. `backdrop-texel` is the same
  image one texel at a time through `net.b12n.raylib-ios.perlin`, which the tests check
  against bytes measured from the C.

  Deviations.
  - **A finger is the pointer.** The lens follows a finger that landed in the
    field and stays where it was left when the finger lifts. A finger that
    lands in the Back region, or slides in from outside the field, does not
    take it. The lens centre is held to the field, so the disc never covers
    the Back button, which means a marker within a lens radius of the field's
    edge is reached with the lens at that edge instead of centred on it.
  - **The field, not an 800 by 450 window.** The scene is the safe region below
    Back. The original's coordinates are laid over it as fractions: x by
    field width over 800 and y by field height over 450, and every length (the
    squares, the circles, the markers, the text) by the smaller of the two, so
    the scene fills the field and the shapes stay round. The backdrop is
    stretched the same way. It is 800 by 450 texels whatever the screen, so on
    a large screen it is enlarged and drawn smooth (linear) where the original's
    is not.
  - **The lens stays 220.** It is the original's size in target pixels, so on
    the phone it is a small disc, and a finger covers it.
  - **The idle path** is the original's, laid over the field the same way.

  The state holds `:frame`, `:lens` (the centre in field pixels), `:moved?` and
  `:held?` (a finger that took the lens is still down). Colours are `[r g b a]`
  vectors."
