  "An on-screen D-pad and an A button that makes a square move and hop. Ported
  from raylib-jolt-demo's `input-virtual-controls` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `input_virtual_controls`).

  The original already is the control scheme a touch device needs, so the port
  keeps its hit testing: a press counts on the pad when it is outside the dead
  centre (22 of 82) and inside the ring, and the angle from the centre picks the
  quadrant, each direction owning the 90 degrees around its own axis. A is a
  plain circle test. The one change is the pointer. The original reads the
  mouse, so one control at a time. Here every point in the input's
  `:touch-points` is tested against the pad and against A, so a thumb on the pad
  and another on A both act, which the single `:pointer` could not say. The
  keyboard path (arrow keys, SPACE) is dropped, because a phone has none.

  The pad sits at the bottom left and A at the bottom right, both clear of
  `gesture/back-region`. The controls are circles, so they share one scale `c`
  taken from the shorter side. The square moves in the play field above them,
  where the original's 800 by 250 area is scaled per axis, `sx` across and `sy`
  down, so the square covers the same share of the field and its position range
  is the original's. Speed and the hop's lift use one factor `u`, the geometric
  mean of the two, because the square moves freely under a D-pad and a per-axis
  speed would make up several times faster than sideways on a tall phone.

  Motion is delta-time based, as in the original (`get-frame-time`): 190 units a
  second, and a hop that decays at 2.4 a second from 1. It reads the input's
  `:delta-seconds`, clamped at 0 the way the Delta Time scene does. Holding A
  keeps the hop at 1, where the sine arc is at rest, as the original does, and
  the square lifts and settles after the finger leaves. The original lets a hop
  rise past the top of its window, which would put the square under the title
  and Back here, so the drawn square is kept inside the field instead.

  A rotation starts the scene over, since the square's position is in the old
  screen's pixels. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, packed by the draw method
  with `rl/rgba`. Text widths are an estimate of 0.6 of the size per character."
