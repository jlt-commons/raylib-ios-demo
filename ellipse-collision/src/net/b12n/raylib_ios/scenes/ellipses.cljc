  "Two ellipses, one of which follows your finger. Both turn red while they
  overlap. A tap on the other ellipse hands the steering to it. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `ellipse-collision` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `ellipse_collision`), itself raylib's `shapes_ellipse_collision`,
  where the mouse steers one ellipse and A and B choose which. It differs from
  `collision`, which is two boxes and an exact intersection rectangle, and from
  `shapes`, whose ellipse is one static fan: here the same fan is reused for two
  moving ones.

  The overlap test is the original's, and it is an approximation. Two ellipses
  have no closed-form test the way two circles do, so `overlap?` walks 64 points
  round one rim and asks whether any lands inside the other, then does the same
  the other way round. The reverse pass catches one ellipse lying wholly inside
  the other. A lens too thin for any sample to land in is still missed, which
  the tests pin down with a measured case. Point-in-ellipse itself is exact: the
  offset divided by each radius, tested against the unit circle, with the rim
  counted as inside.

  The steered ellipse goes to the finger on `:press` and follows it on `:down`,
  and stays where it was on lift, since the `:release` frame carries a stale
  position. A swap is the `:tap` event from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture/track`, judged at
  where the finger STARTED. A touch that starts inside the other ellipse is a
  candidate for a swap, so it never moves the steered one, on the press frame or
  after, and the swap happens when it lifts as a tap. Without that, the steered
  ellipse would leap to the finger during the tap and the swap would hand over
  an ellipse that had just landed on top of the one being picked. The cost is
  that the steered one cannot be dragged from inside the other, including from
  where they overlap. A touch that starts under Back, or that travels too far to
  be a tap, swaps nothing.

  The original's DrawEllipse is rebuilt as `shapes/ellipse-fan` and its outline,
  which is not bound, as `draw-line-ex` segments between the very same rim
  points (`outline`). One factor `f` scales both ellipses, so they keep the
  original's proportions of 120 by 70 and 90 by 140, and the centres are clamped
  to keep each whole ellipse and its stroke inside the screen, below the text
  rows and so below Back."
