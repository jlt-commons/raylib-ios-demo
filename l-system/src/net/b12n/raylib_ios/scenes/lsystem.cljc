  "An L-system plant, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `l-system` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `l_system`).

  A string is rewritten by production rules, then read as turtle graphics: F
  draws forward, + and - turn, [ and ] push and pop. The plant reveals itself
  segment by segment and regrows.

  The rewrite and the turtle walk happen ONCE at init, because the string does
  not change: only how much of it is shown does. That keeps the per-frame cost
  to the draw loop, which is the shape this runtime rewards.")
