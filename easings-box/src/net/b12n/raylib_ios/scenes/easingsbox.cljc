(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.easingsbox
  "A square that drops, flattens into a bar, spins, grows to fill the screen and
  fades out, each stage on its own easing curve. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `easings-box` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `easings_box`), which is raylib's `shapes_easings_box_anim` example. A `:tap`
  from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` restarts it, in place of SPACE, unless it lands in the
  Back region, which belongs to the host.

  The five curves are chosen to contrast, as in the original: elastic-out for
  the drop, so it overshoots and springs back, bounce-out to flatten, quad-out
  for a plain decelerating spin, circ-out for a grow that starts fast and
  brakes hard, and sine-out for a gentle fade. They come from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.easings`,
  which keeps raylib's `(t b c d)` shape.

  Timing is frame-locked, as in the original: it counts frames, never reads a
  clock, and each stage lasts the original's number of frames (120, 120, 240,
  120 and 160). So `advance` reads no `:delta-seconds`. Each property keeps the
  value its own stage left, which is what lets later stages animate on top of
  earlier ones. After the fade the scene holds at `:done`, fully transparent,
  until a tap. Finishing is not a restart trigger, so no gesture value needs
  parking when it happens.

  The original draws with DrawRectanglePro, a rotated rectangle about its
  centre, which is not bound. `quad-corners` computes the four rotated corners
  in this pure namespace and the draw method fills them with two triangles.

  The original works in an 800 by 450 window, with the square dropping in from
  above the top edge and growing past the window's. Here everything lives in the
  safe region below Back, scaled by `u`, the shorter side of that region over
  450. The drop starts with the square's top edge touching Back's lower edge, so
  nothing is ever drawn under the Back button or off the screen. The bar's
  length is 0.9 of the shorter side, so it stays inside at every angle of the
  spin. The box then grows until it fills the region exactly. It has turned 270
  degrees by then, so its local width ends as the region's height and its local
  height as the region's width, which is the original's `W` by `W` growth
  adapted to a window that is not square. In the original the width stays fixed
  during the grow. Here it grows too, since a portrait region is taller than
  the bar is long. Text is laid out in `dimensions`, with widths estimated at
  0.6 of the size per character."
