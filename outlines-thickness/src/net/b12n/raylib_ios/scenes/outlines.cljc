  "Three outlines driven by one thickness: a rectangle, a rounded rectangle and a
  ring, so the same setting can be compared across them. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `outlines-thickness` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `outlines_thickness`), itself raylib's
  `shapes_outlines_thickness` minus its raygui slider. It differs from
  `rounded`, which animates a filled shape's corner radius, and from `ring`,
  which animates an annulus's sweep: here the radius is fixed and the subject is
  the stroke width, including below zero.

  The thickness goes negative, and the original's docstring says what that does.
  raylib guards the plain rectangle with `thick > 0`, so a negative thickness
  draws nothing there. The rounded one collapses to a hairline, with no outward
  band. Only the ring is built from two radii rather than a thickness, so only
  the ring grows outward, and it does. This port reproduces each: `rect-lines`
  returns nothing at or below zero, `rounded-outline` falls back to `hairline`
  and `circle-ring` swaps its radii. One difference is a choice. raylib's
  hairline is whatever its line width is, and here it is one pixel.

  The range is the original's -30 to 30 and the start is its 5. Units are the
  original's pixels at 800 by 450, and `k` scales them, so a shape is 220 units
  wide and a thickness of 30 is the same fraction of it as on the desktop. The
  original sweeps the value on its own until UP or DOWN is pressed. That is kept,
  frame-locked as there: the thickness follows 30 sin(0.02 frame) until the first
  touch outside Back, which then takes over and holds the value it found.

  A vertical drag replaces UP and DOWN. On `:press` the scene records the
  finger's y and the current thickness, and while the finger is down the
  thickness is the anchored one plus `per-px` times the distance dragged up,
  clamped to the range. `per-px` is the range over half the height, so a drag
  across half the screen spans it. The release carries a `:swipe` that is
  IGNORED, because the thickness already moved while the finger was down.
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture/track` is therefore not called: nothing here consumes a tap or
  a swipe. A tap still moves the value by at most `per-px` times the slop, which
  a test pins. Only `:pointer` on `:press` and `:down` is read, never the
  `:release` position, and a press in `gesture/back-region` belongs to the host.

  Bands grow inward from the shape's own edge, as raylib's do, so a rectangle's
  outline stays inside its rectangle. Each straight side spans the whole side,
  which leaves nothing for a corner to notch: the corner square is covered by
  both lines that meet there. The ring's inner radius is the radius less the
  thickness, so a positive thickness is inward. The rounded outline is four
  straight lines plus a quarter ring at each corner, and the corners come from
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.rounded/parts`.

  Shapes sit in three cells, side by side when the screen is wider than tall and
  stacked otherwise, each cell holding a square 280 units across so the ring at
  its most outward still fits. Text sits below Back in `dimensions`."
