  "Two textured cubes under an orbiting camera, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `textured-cube` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `textured_cube`) (zlib licence, after raylib's rlgl immediate-mode textured
  quads). The projection is in software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original (textured_cube.clj) draws, with rlgl quads from one 64 by 64
  atlas, a cube of 2 by 4 by 2 at (-2, 2, 0) that maps the whole atlas over each
  face (`draw-cube-texture`, lines 41-64), and a cube of 2 by 2 by 2 at (2, 1, 0)
  that maps only the atlas's slice u 0 to 0.5, v 0.5 to 1 over each face
  (`draw-cube-texture-rec`, lines 66-90, whose v runs the other way up), then a
  grid of 10 (lines 118-135). The camera is at (14 cos a, 8, 14 sin a) looking
  at the origin, fovy 45, with `a = frame * 0.01` (lines 111-115). `angle` and
  `camera` are those lines. Nothing is read from the frame time, as in the
  original: the angle grows 0.01 radians an update.

  The atlas (lines 21-29) is four solid quadrants: red (230, 41, 55) top left,
  green (0, 158, 47) top right, blue (0, 121, 241) bottom left and yellow
  (253, 249, 0) bottom right, `atlas-pixel` line for line, with v = 0 on the
  top row. There is no texture here, so each face is drawn as the quads of its
  texels: `face-cells` cuts the slice of the atlas the face shows at the
  quadrant boundary u = 0.5 and v = 0.5, and each piece is a flat quad of the
  colour the texture has at its centre. The six faces' vertex lines (their
  corners and their u and v) are the original's, copied as data in `faces`, so
  the quadrants fall where the original puts them, mirrored or turned as its
  vertices turn them. The whole cube's face is four quads, one a quadrant, and
  the slice cube's face is one, since its slice lies inside the blue
  quadrant. Neighbouring quadrants differ in colour, so no same-colour runs
  exist to merge; the texture is reproduced at full resolution, with no cut.
  A texel is a quadrant here because that is all the atlas holds.

  Every quad keeps its original's vertex order, which is counter-clockwise from
  outside, so each is drawn only when it is wound front on the screen, as
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`'s builders do. A face away from the camera makes no
  triangles. Seen from a point, a cube shows at most 3 faces, so a frame is at
  most 3 * 4 * 2 + 3 * 2 = 30 triangles and the grid's 22 lines.

  Paint order, with no `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish`. The grid goes first: both cubes
  stand on or above its plane and the camera is above it, so it is behind
  everything. Within a cube, back-face omission is enough, because a cube is
  convex and its visible faces never overlap on the screen, and the quads of a
  face are coplanar and disjoint. Between the cubes: the plane x = 0 separates
  them (the whole cube spans x -3 to -1, the slice cube 1 to 3), so the cube on
  the camera's side of it is in front wherever the two overlap. `cube-order`
  paints the other one first. A test shoots rays through the field and checks
  the nearer hit is painted last.

  Controls: the original reads no input, so none is mapped. Its text line
  (line 130, at (10, 10), size 18) sits below Back; the 3D view fills the field
  under it, full width to the bottom, and `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens the
  45 degree fovy in a field narrower than 800x450.

  The state holds only `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
