  "Four wireframe solids tumbling side by side, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `wireframe-shapes` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `wireframe_shapes`) (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (0, 3.2, 12) at the origin through a 45 degree
  perspective camera. Each shape is a list of edges in its own space, drawn as
  RL_LINES inside rlPushMatrix/rlPopMatrix after `rlTranslatef(x, 0, 0)` and
  `rlRotatef(spin, 0.4, 1, 0.3)`, where spin is the frame number times 0.9
  degrees. Here that is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/compose` of `translate` and
  `rotate-axis` in the same order, so as in rlgl the turn applies first. The
  shapes are, at x = -6, -2, 2 and 6:

  - a pyramid of 8 edges, a base of 1.3 either side at y = -1 and an apex at
    (0, 1.6, 0), in light red;
  - an octahedron of 12 edges, points 1.5 out on each axis, in light blue;
  - a torus of 196 edges, major radius 1.2 and minor 0.42, 14 steps around the
    ring and 7 around the tube, in light green;
  - a helix of 64 edges, 3 turns of radius 1.2 from y = -1.3 to 1.3, in
    yellow.

  That is 280 line items a frame, all `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/lines`. Every shape's
  edges are built once, at load, as `[p q colour]` segments in model space, so a
  frame only composes four transforms and projects them.

  There is no input and so no control to map, and nothing reads a frame time,
  like the original: the spin grows 0.9 degrees an update. The original's
  dark background and its caption (text 18, raywhite, here sized by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/field`) are kept, the caption below Back with the 3D field
  under it. The original's 45 degree fovy is kept while the field is at least
  as wide as 800x450. In a narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it
  so the original's horizontal view still fits. A line behind the near plane
  is clipped by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/lines`, never wrapped through infinity.

  The state holds only `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
