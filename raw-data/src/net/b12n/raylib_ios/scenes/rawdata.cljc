  "Raw Data, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `raw-data` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `raw_data`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/raw_data.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_raw_data`: a texture is a flat block of bytes this program fills in
  itself. Two panels, a 256 by 256 checkerboard, uploaded once, and a 128 by 128
  panel whose colour is arithmetic on x, y and time.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  Mirrored from raw_data.clj:
  - The sizes (lines 26-38): PANEL 256, LIVE 128, and CHECK 32 for the squares.
  - `checker` (lines 40-45): ORANGE (255, 161, 0) where `(x / 32) + (y / 32)` is
    even, else GOLD (255, 203, 0).
  - `channels` (lines 47-56): with `fx = x / 128` and `fy = y / 128`, red is
    `255 * |sin (6 fx + t)|`, green `255 * |sin (6 fy + 0.7 t)|` and blue
    `255 * |cos (4 (fx + fy) + 1.3 t)|`, each truncated, alpha 255.
  - The clock (line 71): `t = frame * 0.03`.
  - The text (lines 75-124): the heading, the subtitle, the two panel names and
    the stride caption.

  Deviations. The original rewrites all 16384 live texels every frame. That cost
  about 7 ms on a laptop; on the phone a whole refill of the panel is most of
  the 171 ms measured on the first open after launch, so the live panel is
  refreshed a band at a time: each frame refills `band-rows` (3) rows, walking
  down the panel, so every row is refreshed every `period` (43) frames
  (the last band is 2 rows), which is about 1.4 times a second at 60 frames a
  second. The rows of one band share one `t`, but a row refreshed this sweep and
  one refreshed the last are `period` frames apart in time, so a moving seam
  shows between fresh and older rows, and the picture drifts at a fraction of the
  original's rate. The live panel's name says \"a band at a time\" in place of
  \"every frame\". The fps readout is left out. The panels stack on a portrait
  screen and sit side by side on a landscape one, whichever gives the bigger
  square, with each name above its panel.

  The checkerboard is a 64 by 64 texture drawn with `:wrap :repeat` and texcoords
  0 to 4, not the original's 256 by 256 upload. With CHECK 32 the pattern repeats
  every 64 texels, so each drawn texel is the same colour, and the entry fill
  drops from 65536 texels to 4096. Opening the scene again
  costs about 0.15 s, because the banded live panel is not kept.

  The state holds `:frame` and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
