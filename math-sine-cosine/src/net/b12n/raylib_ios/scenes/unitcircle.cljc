  "Sine and cosine as projections of a rotating radius, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `math-sine-cosine` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `math_sine_cosine`).

  A point goes round the unit circle. Its height above the horizontal axis is
  the sine of the angle and its distance along that axis is the cosine, and both
  are drawn as the actual segments rather than described.

  The original stops at the circle, which on a landscape window is the whole
  picture. A phone is tall and leaves most of the screen empty, so the two
  projections are also traced as waves underneath, sharing the circle's vertical
  axis: the height of the blue wave at any moment is the length of the blue
  segment above it. Watching the segment and the wave move together is the point
  the still picture cannot make.

  The trace is a ring buffer of past values rather than a recomputation, so the
  wave is a record of what actually happened rather than a plot of what should
  have."
