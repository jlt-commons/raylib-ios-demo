(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.bezier
  "A cubic Bezier whose far end follows your finger. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `lines-bezier` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `lines_bezier`).

  raylib's `DrawLineBezier` takes its endpoints as by-value Vector2, so the curve
  is sampled here and drawn as segments. That is the third time this suite has
  reached the same conclusion, and each time it has been an improvement rather
  than a workaround: sampling in Clojure is what let `splines` draw three bases
  over shared points, and it is what lets this one show its control polygon.

  The control points are placed from the two endpoints rather than dragged
  separately, which is what the original does with a mouse it can move freely.
  A finger has one position, so the handles are derived: each pulls horizontally
  toward the other end by a fixed fraction of the gap. That keeps the curve
  well-behaved at every finger position, including the degenerate one where the
  finger is on the anchor."
