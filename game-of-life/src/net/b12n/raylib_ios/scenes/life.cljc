  "Conway's Game of Life, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `game-of-life` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `game_of_life`).

  Four rules, no exceptions: a live cell with two or three live neighbours
  survives, a dead cell with exactly three becomes live, everything else dies.
  The grid wraps at both edges, so it is a torus and nothing falls off.

  The original is 80x45 on a landscape window with SPACE to reseed. Here the
  grid is derived from the screen, and there is no reseed key because there are
  no keys: the population is watched instead, and a board that has stopped
  changing or died out reseeds itself.

  Cost is the live population, one rectangle each, so it is highest in the first
  second and settles as the soup does. The cell size is chosen to keep the
  opening frame inside the budget rather than the steady state, which is about
  a third of it."
  (:require [clojure.string]))

(def default-seed 1848)

;; Chosen so the opening population lands near a thousand rectangles, which
;; docs/guide/performance-on-a-phone.md puts inside the comfortable range. A
;; finer grid looks better for about a second and then costs frames for the
;; rest of the run.
