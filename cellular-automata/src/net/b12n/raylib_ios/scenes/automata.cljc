(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.automata
  "Elementary cellular automata, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `cellular-automata` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `cellular_automata`).

  Wolfram's one-dimensional rules, one generation per row. Each cell's next
  state is decided by itself and its two neighbours, and the eight possible
  neighbourhoods are read off the eight bits of the rule number. Rule 30 is
  chaotic, rule 90 draws a Sierpinski triangle, and rule 110 is complicated
  enough to be Turing complete.

  Two changes from the original, both forced by the device.

  It scrolls. The original computes the whole triangle once and redraws every
  cell every frame, which on a phone screen is tens of thousands of rectangles
  and nowhere near a frame budget. Here a bounded window of generations is
  kept: it fills from a single live cell, and once full the oldest row falls off
  the top. That also makes it something to watch rather than a static image,
  which suits a scene that has no keys to change the rule with.

  Each row is drawn as runs of adjacent live cells rather than one rectangle
  per cell. Rule 30 averages a little over two cells per run, so this is most of
  a third of the draw calls for an identical picture.

  The rules cycle on their own, since the original stepped through them with
  the arrow keys and there is no keyboard here."

(defn dimensions
  "Cell width and row height are chosen separately.

  Width comes from the column count, which is what decides whether the
  automaton is legible: 92 columns is enough to read rule 30 and few enough to
  draw. Height is then whatever fills the space, which on this screen makes a
  row about 1.6 times taller than a cell is wide.

  Making them equal was the first attempt and left the pattern occupying the
  top 39% of the display with white below it, because a square cell wide enough
  to draw quickly is also too wide to need many rows."
