(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.gestures
  "What raylib's own gesture recogniser reports, named and logged. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `input-gestures` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `input_gestures`), which is raylib's `core_input_gestures` example
  (zlib licence).

  The original calls GetGestureDetected each frame, and when the code differs
  from the previous frame's and the finger is inside the test box it pushes the
  gesture's name onto a log of 20, newest at the bottom, drawn down the left with
  alternating rows and the newest in maroon. A maroon circle of radius 30 follows
  the finger while any gesture is set. The log is a rule on the code, not on the
  time: a gesture raylib keeps reporting is one entry, and the previous code
  updates every frame whether or not an entry was made, so a gesture that begins
  outside the box and carries on inside it is not logged either.

  Here `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gallery` hands the code down as `:raylib-gesture`, read by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/get-gesture-detected`. The recogniser is raylib's own: this scene
  only names what it says, and runs it unchanged. The 10 codes are
  `raylib.h`'s `Gesture` enum, and a code outside them is logged as \"GESTURE\"
  and the number.

  Where the finger is comes from `:pointer`, which the gallery already gives in
  scene coordinates, so GetTouchX is not called. Only a `:press` or `:down`
  position is read. On any other frame the last position seen on one is used, so
  a tap or a swipe that raylib reports at the moment of release lands where the
  finger last was, and the release position (which is stale) is never read. If
  no position has ever been seen, a gesture cannot be placed and is not logged,
  but it still becomes the previous code.

  What differs from the original:
  - Pinch in and pinch out never appear. raylib's SDL platform feeds its
    gesture system one touch point at a time, so a pinch is never two points
    to it. The table keeps both names, the scene says so on screen as one hint
    line, and the catalog row says it too. Tap, double-tap, hold, drag and the
    four swipes can appear.
  - The mouse controls become a finger on the glass, which is all there is.
  - The test box is the field below Back, and the log is stacked above it in
    portrait and runs down its left in landscape. The original's 800 by 450
    window had room for 20 rows beside the box, a phone in portrait does not.
    Text sizes come from `dimensions`, which shrinks them until 20 rows and the
    longest name fit.
  - The original calls SetGesturesEnabled with every flag. That is not bound
    here, since raylib enables all ten by default.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
