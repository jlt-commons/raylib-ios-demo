  "Polygon Drawing, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `polygon-drawing` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `polygon_drawing`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/polygon_drawing.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_polygon_drawing`: a hue wheel mapped onto a spinning ten-sided
  polygon, drawn as a triangle fan, the same reimplementation of DrawTexturePoly
  the C example uses. The original has no polygon helper in its library; the fan
  is written out in the example (lines 85-101), and `fan` here is that loop.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  Mirrored from polygon_drawing.clj:
  - The texture (lines 35-59): 256 by 256 (line 23), the angle of each texel
    around the middle as a hue at full saturation and value, `hsv->colour` and
    `wheel-colour`.
  - `TEXCOORDS` (lines 27-29) and `POINTS` (lines 32-33), the points being
    `(uv - 0.5) * 256`.
  - The fan (lines 85-101): ten triangles, each the middle at uv (0.5, 0.5) and
    two neighbouring points rotated by the angle about the middle, with the
    neighbours' own uvs; the last point repeats the first, so the loop closes.
  - The spin (lines 76-77): the angle grows 1.0 degree a frame, with no wrap, and
    `DEG2RAD` is 0.0174532925 (line 24).
  - The caption (lines 80-83): \"textured polygon\", DARKGRAY.

  Deviations. The polygon is scaled so that its farthest point, at a distance of
  143 from the middle, sits at 45 percent of the shorter free side, and the middle
  is the middle of the free area under the caption. At a scale of 1 and the
  middle at (400, 225) the fan is the original's to the digit. The caption is
  fitted to the width. Update runs before draw, so the first drawn frame is
  already at 1 degree, as in the original, whose angle is added before use.

  Wrap. The sheet is clamped. Every uv here lies in 0..1, so nothing needs
  REPEAT, and a clamp keeps a vertex sitting exactly on u or v of 1.0 from
  sampling the far side.

  Entry cost. The first open after launch pauses for about 0.8 s on the phone
  (the largest single frame, measured), while the texture's pixels are computed
  and uploaded. Opening it again takes about one frame, because the filled
  texture buffer is kept.

  The state holds `:angle` and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
