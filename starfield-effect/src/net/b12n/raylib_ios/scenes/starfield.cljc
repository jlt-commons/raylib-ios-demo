  "Stars flying at the viewer, dragged faster or slower. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `starfield-effect` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `starfield_effect`), which is raylib's `shapes_starfield_effect` example. It is
  a different scene from `stars`, which is a twinkle: those stars drift and
  pulse in place, while these fly toward the camera under a perspective
  projection and respawn at the far plane.

  The original changes speed on the MOUSE WHEEL and toggles streaks against
  circles on SPACE. Here a vertical DRAG sets the speed and a `:tap` from
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` toggles the mode, unless it lands in the Back region, which
  belongs to the host. A drag that starts in Back starts no speed change.

  The drag keeps its own anchor, because the gesture layer only reports a swipe
  at the release. On `:press` the scene records the finger's y and the current
  speed. While the finger is down the speed is the anchored one plus `k` times
  the distance dragged up, clamped to the original's 0.1 to 2.0. `k` is the
  range divided by the safe region's height, so a drag across the full height
  spans the whole range, the way a wheel's several notches would. Only the raw
  `:pointer` on `:press` and `:down` is read, never the `:release`. The same
  finger then reports a `:swipe` on release (it is a vertical drag), which is
  IGNORED, because nothing here reads swipes: the speed only changes while the
  finger is down, so the release cannot apply the drag a second time. A tap
  travels at most `gesture/slop`, which changes the speed by well under 5 % of
  the range in either orientation (a test pins that), so a tap that toggles the
  mode barely touches the speed.

  Motion is delta-time based, as in the original (`get-frame-time`): `z` falls
  by `speed * dt` a second from 1. It reads the input's `:delta-seconds`,
  clamped at 0 the way the Delta Time scene does. The original's frame time is
  unbounded above and so is this one.

  A star is stored in the original's normalized space: `nx` and `ny` are
  fractions of the width and height in [-0.5, 0.5), the original's `x` over `W`
  and `y` over `H`. Projection is `centre + n * size / z`, taken from the
  current `:screen` every frame, so it matches the original at 800 by 450. A
  rotation therefore needs no reset: the same stars simply project onto the new
  screen. A star respawns, at z 1, when z goes negative or its projection leaves
  the screen, as in the original. The original draws a circle of radius
  `1 + 4 z` and a streak from the projection at `z + 1/32` (at least 0.01 and at
  most 1), both one pixel at 450 high, and here both scale by the shorter side
  over 450 so they are visible on a phone.

  Random numbers come from the project's LCG, taking its HIGH bits (the low bit
  alternates on every step). The seed is fixed, so a field replays. Text is
  laid out in `dimensions`, below Back, with widths estimated at 0.6 of the size
  per character."
