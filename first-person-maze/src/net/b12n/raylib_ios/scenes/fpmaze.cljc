  "A first-person walk through a grid maze, with a minimap, on two thumbs,
  ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `first-person-maze` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `first_person_maze`) (zlib licence).

  The maze is the original's 16 by 16 vector of strings (lines 22-38), which is
  also its collision map. Each `#` is a wall cube of CELL 4 by 3 by 4 at
  `((cx + 0.5) * CELL, 1.5, (cy + 0.5) * CELL)`, tinted as the original does
  (lines 64-73) with a checker, (120, 130, 160) where `cx + cy` is even and
  (95, 105, 135) where it is odd, then shaded face by face by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default, which is `cube!`'s. A grid of 40 slices of
  CELL is drawn first, on a clear colour of (16, 18, 26), from an eye 1.6 up
  looking one unit along the heading, `fovy` 68 (lines 133-140). The
  projection is in software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`, so the state holds numbers
  only and the draw method builds the draw list.

  The original builds its own camera and does not call `UpdateCamera`, and
  neither does this. The heading is an angle about the vertical and forward is
  `(sin h, cos h)`, so heading 0 looks down +z (lines 137-139: `target = pos +
  (sinh, cosh)`). Movement is the original's too. A step is `speed = 5 * dt`
  (line 122) with `dx = speed * (fwd * sinh + strafe * cosh)` and `dz = speed *
  (fwd * cosh - strafe * sinh)` (lines 125-126). It is resolved per axis, x
  first, so a diagonal into a wall keeps the component that is free and slides
  (lines 129-131): `blocked?` tests the four corners of a box of RADIUS 0.9
  (lines 48-57), and a blocked move is dropped, not clamped to the wall. The
  start is `(1.5 CELL, 1.5 CELL)` at heading 0. `dt` is the update's
  `:delta-seconds`, as the original's `GetFrameTime`.

  The original's keys, and what stands in for each:
  - W and S walk forward and back, A and D strafe, and LEFT and RIGHT turn at
    2.2 radians a second. A relative thumb-stick that starts in the lower third
    of the field replaces W, S, A and D. The press point is its centre. Further
    than `gesture/slop` from it, the player moves that way (up the glass is
    forward) at `5 * dt`, the direction a unit vector, so one speed everywhere.
    The original's keys add, which makes a diagonal 1.41 times faster, and that
    is a deliberate difference. A drag that starts in the upper two thirds of
    the field replaces LEFT and RIGHT. Only its horizontal motion turns, as the
    original has no pitch. A drag right turns right, as RIGHT does, and it turns
    0.004 radians a pixel, times `800 / field width`. That rate is borrowed from
    `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.fpcamera`, because a key has no pixel rate to port.
  - D adds +x at heading 0. The camera there looks down +z, where +x is the
    left of the glass (probed with `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/project`: the point one unit
    along +x projects left of centre), and A adds -x, the right. So the
    original's D is a strafe to the left of the glass and its A one to the
    right, and so is the LEFT key's turn, which raises the heading toward +x.
    The stick maps by what shows on the glass: pushed right it strafes right,
    which is the original's A key's effect. A drag follows the same side.
  - Both work at once, each by its own finger.

  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick` decides whose finger it is, as in `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.fpcamera`
  (`stick/begin-owners` and `stick/follow-pair` are shared): a stick or a
  turn begins only on a finger that was not down the frame before, inside its
  region, follows it by touch id, and ends when it lifts. A rotation of the
  phone drops both. A tap moves nothing.

  The minimap is the original's (lines 75-103), in the top right of the 3D field,
  drawn after the 3D draw list. A black panel of alpha 170, one rect for each
  wall in (150, 160, 190), a RED circle of radius 4 at the player's cell
  position and a GOLD line of 12 from it along `(sin h, cos h)`. The original's
  800 pixel window has a cell of 9, a margin of 4 round the panel and a gap of
  1 between wall rects. Here the cell `s` is sized in `dimensions` so the panel
  is at most 0.3 of the field's width and 0.4 of its height, and the 4, the 4,
  the 12 and the 1 scale by `s / 9`.

  Dropped: the title text (the gallery shows the scene's title) and the
  key text, \"W/S walk A/D strafe LEFT/RIGHT turn\", which becomes a caption
  below Back for the touch controls, sized in `dimensions` so it fits.

  Faces with a corner behind the near plane are dropped whole, a known limit of
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`, so standing against a wall makes its face vanish rather than
  clip. The grid is drawn under every face (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` puts all
  grid lines first), so a grid line that a depth buffer would show over a wall's
  foot is hidden here. Adjacent walls are ordered whole, face by face, so where
  two cross a face can paint over one a depth buffer would put in front. Both
  are limits of the painter, not chased. The original's 68 degree fovy is kept
  while the field is at least as wide as 800x450, and widened by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a narrower one.

  Walls that cannot show are not built. `frustum-walls` leaves out those
  wholly behind the eye or outside the side planes of the view, and
  `visible-walls` those that rays across the maze grid cannot reach, because
  other walls stand in front (the maze is walls full height around an eye in
  their height range, so that is a question in plan). A face that the cube
  drops for a corner behind the near plane hides nothing, as in the picture.
  The two together take a corridor view from 137 cubes to a few dozen.

  The state holds `:px`, `:pz` and `:heading` (numbers), the finger tracking
  (`:look` and `:stick`, each with its finger's id), `:n`, `:pts` and `:ids` (the
  finger count, touch points and ids of last frame) and `:screen`. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors."
