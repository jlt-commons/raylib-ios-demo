  "Two players on a plane of cube trees, each seen by its own camera in half of
  the screen, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `camera-3d-split-screen` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera_3d_split_screen`) (zlib licence,
  from raylib's `core_3d_camera_split_screen`). The projection is in software,
  by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original (camera_3d_split_screen.clj) draws, for each player, the same
  world into a 400 by 450 render texture on a sky blue clear: a 50 by 50 beige
  plane (lines 19-22), then for i and j in -5 to 5 (`COUNT` 5, lines 24-37) at
  `SPACING` 4 a lime cube of side 1 at (4i, 1.5, 4j) and a brown post of 0.25 by
  1 by 0.25 at (4i, 0.5, 4j), then the two players as cubes of side 1 (lines
  38-47): player one red at (0, 1, z1) and player two blue at (x2, 3, 0). Every
  cube is `draw-cube!`, so each is flat coloured and drawn here with
  `{:shade :flat}`. The cameras (lines 98-117) have fovy 45, perspective, up
  (0, 1, 0). Player one's eye is its cube, (0, 1, z1), looking at (0, 1, z1 + 3).
  Player two's is (x2, 3, 0) looking at (x2 + 3, 3, 0). Both start at -3
  (line 76). Each half gets a bar of 40 by 400 in white at alpha 204 with a size
  20 label at (10, 10): \"PLAYER1: W/S to move\" in MAROON and \"PLAYER2: UP/DOWN
  to move\" in DARKBLUE. The halves are blitted side by side with a 4 pixel
  LIGHTGRAY divider.

  Controls: W and S move player one along z by `10 * GetFrameTime()` (lines
  81-83), and UP and DOWN move player two along x the same way (lines 84-86).
  Neither is clamped. Here a relative thumb-stick in each half replaces the
  keys, one `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick` per half. A stick starts only on a fresh press (a
  finger that was not down the frame before) inside its own half, follows only
  that finger by its touch id (by nearness when the host gives none), and ends
  when that finger lifts or slides out of the half. It never adopts another
  finger, so a finger resting in a half never steers it, and the two halves are
  steered at once by two thumbs. A rotation of the phone drops both sticks.
  A key moves along one axis only, so the stick reads only the way the thumb
  has gone up or down from where it first touched, once it is further than
  `gesture/slop` from it: up the glass is W (or UP), forward along the
  player's own look, down is S (or DOWN). The speed is the original's 10 units
  a second times `:delta-seconds`, and the same whatever the distance. A tap
  moves nothing. The release position is never read.

  The render textures become two viewports from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/field`'s field,
  stacked in portrait (player one on top) and side by side in landscape, each
  with its own `view-proj` and its own scissor in its draw method.
  Each camera is fitted to its half by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` against the
  original's 400 by 450 half, so a half at least that wide keeps the original's
  45 degree fovy. The bar keeps the original's proportions, its height twice
  and its margin half of the label size, which is the original's 20 times the
  scale of the half and is cut back when the label would not fit.

  Limits of the painter, kept and disclosed rather than chased:
  - The plane is drawn by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/plane`, which drops a quad whole when a
    corner is behind the near plane. Both eyes are inside the original's 50 by 50
    plane, so the plane is cut to the part ahead of the eye, from a depth of
    half the one at which the bottom edge of the glass meets the ground, which
    is out of sight, and the picture is the original's. It is painted first,
    under everything, because the eyes are above it and every cube stands on or
    over it, whereas `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` would order it by its centre.
  - A cube with a corner behind the near plane is dropped whole, so a tree the
    player walks into vanishes instead of being clipped.
  - Cubes are painted whole, far to near by the distance of their centres from
    the eye, and `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` is not called (sorting every triangle
    cost more than the phone's budget), so where two overlap a face can paint
    over one a depth buffer would put in front.
  - The cubes a camera cannot see (wholly behind the eye or outside the sides of
    its view, by a circle round each tree) are not built, which leaves the
    picture unchanged.
  - A cube's triangles that lie wholly outside the half's rectangle (all three
    corners more than a pixel past one side) are not built either, because the
    half is scissored to that rectangle, so this too leaves the picture
    unchanged. About a fifth of the triangles at the start are such.
  - The cubes are built by a private copy of `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s sums
    (`flat-cubes`) that makes the same triangles with less overhead per cube, and
    the sort key is worked out once a cube, not once a comparison. The gallery
    keeps each half's list while neither player moves.

  Dropped: the key text, whose words become \"PLAYER1: drag to move\" and
  \"PLAYER2: drag to move\". The state holds `:z1` and `:x2` (numbers), the
  sticks, the finger count, points and ids of the frame before, and `:screen`.
  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
