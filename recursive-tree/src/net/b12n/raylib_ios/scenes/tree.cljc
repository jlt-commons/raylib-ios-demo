(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.tree
  "A binary fractal tree, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `recursive-tree` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `recursive_tree`).

  Each branch spawns two shorter children at plus and minus `branch-spread`, ten deep,
  which is 1023 branches. The original recurses and draws in the same pass;
  here the recursion returns segments and the host draws them, which is what
  the scene contract asks for and also what lets the whole tree be built once
  at init instead of every frame.

  A slow sway is the one thing added: the original is a still, and a scene that
  never changes looks broken next to the others in the gallery. The sway is a
  per-frame angle offset, so the tree is rebuilt each frame, which is why depth
  is 9 here rather than 10.")
