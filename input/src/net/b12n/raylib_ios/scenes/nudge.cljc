  "A ball moved with a thumb-stick. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `input` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `input`), which is
  raylib's `core_input_keys` example.

  The original moves a MAROON circle of radius 50 by 2 pixels a frame along each
  arrow key held, from the middle of an 800x450 window, with a DARKGRAY caption
  at (10, 10). Here the ball follows a relative thumb-stick, as Vampire
  Survivors does: wherever a finger lands is the stick's centre, and while it
  stays down the vector from there to the finger is the direction. Inside
  `gesture/slop` of the centre there is no direction, so a tap or a trembling
  finger never moves the ball. Outside it the ball goes that way at the
  original's 2 pixels a frame, the vector normalised, so a diagonal is no
  faster. The original's digital keys add the two axes, which makes a diagonal
  2.83 pixels a frame, and that is the one deliberate difference. `stick-dir` is
  the rule as a pure function. A press under `gesture/back-region` belongs to
  the host and starts no stick, and a release never moves the ball.

  The original lets the ball leave the window. Here its centre is held a radius
  inside the play field, which is the full width below the caption, so the
  whole ball stays on the glass and can never cover the line. The original
  draws its ball over the text instead. The clamp runs every frame, so a rotation pulls the ball
  back in.

  This is frame-locked, like the original, which never reads a frame time. The
  800x450 game is scaled into the field by one factor `:u`, the geometric mean
  of the two axes' scales, which applies to the radius and the speed because the
  motion is free in two dimensions. The caption's size uses the smaller scale
  so it fits whichever way the phone is held. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors.
  The draw method packs them with `rl/rgba`."
