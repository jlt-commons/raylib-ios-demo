(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.dirbillboard
  "A walking figure on a camera-facing billboard, whose pose changes as the
  camera goes round it, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `directional-billboard` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `directional_billboard`) (zlib
  licence, after raylib's models_directional_billboard). The projection is in
  software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original (directional_billboard.clj) keeps its camera on a circle of
  radius `RXZ` 2.828 (the square root of 8) at y = 1, looking at (0, 0.5, 0),
  fovy 45 (lines 28 and 125-137). The angle `theta` starts at pi / 4 and gains
  0.5 times the frame time a frame (lines 114 and 120). The sheet is 8 rows, the
  facing direction, by 4 columns, the walk frame. The row is chosen from the
  camera's own angle (lines 127-128): `dir0 = floor(atan2(z, x) / pi * 4 +
  1/4)`, and `dir` is `dir0` or, when that is negative, `8 + dir0`. `direction`
  is that line for line, and a test compares it with a copy of it at about 2400
  angles, and with hand-computed edges. The column advances when a timer passes
  0.5 s (lines 121-124): the timer gains the frame time, and past 0.5 the walk
  frame steps (mod 4) and the timer starts over, dropping the excess. A
  grid of 10 lies under it (line 139) and the figure is a billboard of side 1 at
  (0, 0.5, 0) (lines 140-147). Here the frame time is the update's
  `:delta-seconds`.

  The sheet (lines 49-69) is a 24 pixel cell per pose, drawn by `sheet-pixel`:
  a round head of radius 5 at (12, 8) in value 1, a body at x 9 to 14 and y 13
  to 19 in value 0.7, and two legs at y 20 to 22 in value 0.5, at x `10 + o`
  to `11 + o` and `12 - o` to `13 - o` where the offset `o` of the column is 0,
  2, 0, -2 (line 47), all of hue 45 degrees a row, saturation 0.7, and
  transparent elsewhere. There is no texture here, so each pose is redrawn as
  eight flat rectangles, `cell-rects`, in the same cell: the two legs, the body,
  and the head as five rectangles, one for the pixel rows it spans, 5, 7, 9
  (five rows), 7 and 5 pixels wide, which is the circle's `r < 5` test row by
  row. All of it is the original's pixels exactly, and a test paints them over a
  cell and compares all 576 pixels of all 32 poses with the original's rule. Each
  rectangle is a part of the billboard (`cell->part`), so the eight rows are eight
  colours and the four columns are four leg positions.

  One mirror. The original's quad takes its right from `cross(world-up,
  forward)`, which is the camera's LEFT, and puts the sheet's u = 0 edge there.
  So the figure on its screen is the sheet left to right reversed, and this scene
  keeps that: `cell->part` flips x, so a leg that is at the left of the cell is at
  the right of the picture, as the original draws it. A test builds the
  original's texel positions and compares them with the corners of each part.

  The rectangles are coplanar and painted legs, body, head, so painter order is
  exact; there is no `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish`. The grid goes first. The camera is 1
  up and the billboard stands on the grid, so the grid is behind the figure
  wherever the two overlap on the screen.

  Controls: the original reads no input, so none is mapped. Its two text lines
  (\"animation: N\" and \"direction frame: N\", at (10, 10) and (10, 40), size 20)
  become one, \"animation: N  direction frame: N\", below Back; the 3D view fills
  the field under it, full width to the bottom, and `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera`
  widens the 45 degree fovy in a field narrower than 800x450.

  The state holds `:theta`, `:anim`, `:timer` and `:frame`. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors."
