(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.multitouch
  "Every finger on the glass, drawn where it is. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `input-multitouch` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `input_multitouch`).

  The original says plainly what it could not do: raylib's per-index
  GetTouchPosition returns a Vector2 by value, the desktop binding set had no
  path for that, so it read point zero through the scalar GetTouchX and GetTouchY
  pair. Its own docstring calls that the honest limit, the ids of every point
  visible and the coordinates of only the first.

  Here it is the whole scene. A phone is the machine that actually has the
  hardware the example was written about, `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/touch-position` returns
  the by-value Vector2, and the gallery hands every active point down under
  `:touch-points`. So this draws all of them, each with its raylib id and its own
  colour, and a trail behind each one.

  Trails are keyed by touch id rather than by position in the list. raylib does
  not promise ids are 0..n-1, and when a middle finger lifts the remaining points
  shift down an index. Keying by index would make two fingers swap trails on the
  lift, which looks like a glitch and is really a bookkeeping mistake."

(defn assign-colours
  "Give every live touch a palette slot, keeping what an existing one already had.

  Colour comes from a slot rather than from the id, and the id is the obvious
  thing to reach for. Two findings killed that.

  First, iOS touch ids are derived from object pointers, so they are 8-byte
  aligned. Four real fingers on an iPhone 17 Pro reported 809313472, 809313920,
  809314368 and 809317952: every one divisible by 8, so `(mod id 8)` sent all
  four to the same entry and every finger drew in the same blue. Shifting the
  alignment away does not save it either, because those ids step by 448, which
  is still a multiple of 8.

  Second, and the reason no hash fixes this: with eight colours and four
  fingers, a perfectly uniform hash still collides. The chance all four land in
  different slots is 8/8 x 7/8 x 6/8 x 5/8, which is 41%. A murmur3 finalizer
  measured 41% here, so it was already ideal and still wrong more often than
  not.

  Assigning the lowest free slot instead makes distinctness exact for up to
  `(count palette)` simultaneous touches, which is more than any phone reports.
  A finger keeps its slot for as long as it is down, and slots are recycled only
  when it lifts."
