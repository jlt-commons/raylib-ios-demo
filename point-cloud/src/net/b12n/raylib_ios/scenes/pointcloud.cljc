(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.pointcloud
  "A cloud of points turning slowly, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `point-cloud` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `point_cloud`)
  (zlib licence), with fewer points.

  The original makes 1500 points with `GetRandomValue(-50, 50) / 10` for each of
  x, y and z, colours each `(int (+ 128 (* 25 c)))` per axis with alpha 255, and
  draws each as a cube of side 0.06 inside `rlRotatef(frame * 0.3, 0, 1, 0)`,
  seen from (0, 0, 12) at the origin through a 45 degree perspective camera on
  black. Here `GetRandomValue` is the project's LCG seeded with 20261002,
  taking its high bits (`(mod (quot seed' 65536) 101)`, minus 50), so the cloud
  is the same every run. The distribution, colours, rotation and camera are the
  original's.

  There are 400 points here, where the original has 1500. They are the first
  400 of the cloud the 1500 would be. The first version of this port, with all
  1500 points as squares sorted by `finish`, ran at 9 fps on an iPhone 17 Pro,
  110 ms a frame.

  The points are drawn as screen-space squares, not cubes. A cube of side 0.06
  is a few pixels across and its shades cannot be told apart, so each point is
  the square its face would cover seen head on: a side of `0.06 * k / depth`
  pixels, where `k = 0.5 * viewport-height / tan(fovy/2)`. It wears the point's
  colour unshaded (a cube's front and top faces take shade 1.0, its sides 0.7
  to 0.85) and is wound the way rlgl keeps. A cube takes about six triangles to
  the square's two.

  Squares are painted far to near by depth bucket (`scene-list`), not by a
  full sort. There is no input and so no control to map. The original's caption
  says \"each a tiny rlgl cube\"; here it says \"each a tiny square\", because that
  is what is drawn, and it gives this scene's count. It sits below Back, with
  the 3D view in the field under it, full width to the bottom, clipped to it by
  the draw method. The original's fovy is kept while the field is at least as
  wide as 800x450, and in a narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it
  so the original's horizontal view still fits. In a wide field the cloud's
  nearest points lie outside the view, as they do in the original.

  The state holds only `:frame`; the points are a constant. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors."
