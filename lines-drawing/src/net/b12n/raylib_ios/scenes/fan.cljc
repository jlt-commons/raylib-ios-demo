  "A turning fan of thick lines, each a different width and colour. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `lines-drawing` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `lines_drawing`), itself raylib's `shapes_lines_drawing` without
  its texture cursor.

  The subject is line thickness, which sounds like nothing until you try to draw
  a thick line. raylib's `DrawLineEx` takes both endpoints as by-value Vector2,
  so this project builds thick lines from rlgl quads, and every one of those
  quads has to be wound correctly or it vanishes. A fan of sixteen at sixteen
  widths is a direct test of that: any width that fails to appear is a bug, and
  it is obvious which.

  Widths run from under a pixel to a fat bar. The thin end matters most, because
  a quad narrower than a pixel is where a rounding error stops being invisible
  and starts being a gap in the fan."
