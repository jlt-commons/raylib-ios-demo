(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.billboard
  "Two camera-facing billboards over a grid, one of them spinning, with the
  camera going round them, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `billboard-rendering` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `billboard_rendering`) (zlib
  licence, after raylib's models_billboard_rendering). The projection is in
  software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`, whose `billboard` builds each quad from the same
  corner maths as rmodels.c's DrawBillboardPro.

  The original (billboard_rendering.clj) keeps its camera at `ORBIT-R` 7.07
  from the y axis and 4 up, looking at (0, 2, 0), fovy 45, up (0, 1, 0) (lines
  24 and 105-106, and `with-camera-3d` at 130-133). The angle starts at 0.8 and
  gains 0.5 times the frame time a frame (line 103), and the spin gains 0.4
  degrees a frame with no frame time (line 104). A static billboard of side 2 sits
  at (0, 2, 0) and a spinning one at (1, 2, 1) (lines 25-26 and 115-122), over a
  `DrawGrid(10, 1)` (line 110). The farther of the two, by the squared distance of
  its centre from the camera, is drawn first (lines 107-108 and 123-125). Here the
  frame time is the update's `:delta-seconds`.

  The corners are the original's: `draw-billboard` (lines 61-88) builds
  `center +/- right h +/- up h` with `right` from the camera's forward vector and
  `up` from `right`, which are the camera's own right and up, and the spin is a
  Rodrigues turn of both about the forward vector (lines 47-54 and 69-71).
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/billboard-corners` is that quad. Its turn is about the quad's
  normal, `right` x `up`, which points at the camera where the original's
  forward points away, so the same spin is the other sign there (`rotation`).
  A test compares the corners with a copy of the original's `draw-billboard` at
  every sampled frame. One real difference: the original's `right` is
  `cross(world-up, forward)`, which is the camera's LEFT, so its quad is a
  mirror of the image on the texture. raylib's DrawBillboardPro, which the
  corners follow, is not mirrored. The atlas here is symmetric, so nothing shows.

  The atlas (lines 28-36) is a 64 by 64 texture: yellow (253, 249, 0) inside a
  radius of 0.35 of half the width, red (230, 41, 55) inside 0.7, blue (0, 121,
  241) elsewhere, corners included. There is no texture here, so it is redrawn as
  three flat squares of the circles' diameters, blue the whole billboard, red 0.7
  of its side and yellow 0.35 of it (`ring-parts`), painted in that order as
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/billboard`'s `:part`s. The squares are larger than the circles
  they replace, by the corners, and they visibly turn with the spin where the
  original's circles show no turning at all (only its blue square's edge does).
  Discs built of strips through `:part` measured 0.62 ms a frame on the laptop,
  over the 0.30 ms target (the performance guide's \"Sizing a scene on the
  laptop\"), so they are not used.

  Each billboard's parts are coplanar and painted back to front, and the two
  billboards are on parallel planes, both perpendicular to the view axis, so
  painting them by depth along that axis, farther first, is exact and there is
  no `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish`: the grid goes first, then the farther billboard, then
  the nearer. This is not the original's rule, which sorts by the distance of the
  centre from the camera and is wrong for about 5.7 degrees of each lap
  (see `paint-order`); the original's depth buffer hides that. The grid is always
  behind them, because the camera is above the grid and above the billboards.

  Controls: the original reads no input (it has no key), so none is mapped. The
  one text line (line 135) sits below Back, not at (10, 40), with the 3D view in
  the field under it, full width to the bottom, and `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera`
  widens the 45 degree fovy in a field narrower than 800x450, so the horizontal
  view still fits.

  The state holds `:angle`, `:spin` and `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
