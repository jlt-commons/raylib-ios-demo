  "The raylib logo, still. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `logo` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `logo`): a thick black square
  border built from two rectangles, a black one with a background-coloured one
  inside it, and 'raylib' tucked into the bottom-right corner of the inside.

  It differs from `logoanim`, which is the same logo assembling itself over a few
  hundred frames. This one is the finished picture and nothing moves, so there
  is no state worth keeping beyond the screen it was laid out for, and no input
  is read.

  The original is 256 pixels square with a 16 pixel border and 40 pixel text in
  an 800 by 450 window. Here the size is the smaller of 0.72 of the shorter side
  and the room below Back, so it never reaches the Back button, and the border,
  the text and the 4 pixel gap in the corner scale with it. The logo is centred
  across the screen and down the region below Back.

  Where the label goes depends on its width, which a pure namespace cannot ask
  raylib for. `layout` takes a `measure` function `(fn [s size] -> px)`. The draw
  method passes the real one and the tests pass an estimate of 0.6 of the size
  per character. Text is sized in `dimensions`."
