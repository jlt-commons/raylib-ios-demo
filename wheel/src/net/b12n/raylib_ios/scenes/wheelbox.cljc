  "A box dragged up and down. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `wheel` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `wheel`), which is
  raylib's `core_input_mouse_wheel` example.

  The original moves a MAROON square of side 80, centred across an 800x450
  window, by 20 pixels a wheel notch, held inside the window, with a DARKGRAY
  caption at (10, 10). A phone has no wheel, so a vertical DRAG moves the box
  instead. The scene keeps its own anchor, because the gesture layer only reports
  a swipe at the release. On `:press` below Back it records the finger's y and
  the box's y. While the finger is down the box is at the anchored y plus the
  distance the finger has moved since, so the box follows the finger one for one
  and a drag back to where it started returns the box. The distance is read in
  screen pixels, which are already the scaled units, so the original's 20 pixel
  notch becomes whatever the finger travels. Only the raw `:pointer` on `:press`
  and `:down` is read, never the `:release`. The same finger reports a `:swipe`
  on release, which nothing here reads, so the drag is never applied a second
  time. A press under `gesture/back-region` belongs to the host and anchors
  nothing.

  The play field is the full width, from the bottom of Back to the bottom of the
  screen, and the box is held wholly inside it, as the original holds it inside
  the window. The clamp runs every frame, so a rotation pulls the box back in.
  The box is the original's 80 scaled by one factor `:u`, the geometric mean of
  the two axes' scales, and sits in the middle of the width. The caption uses
  the smaller scale so it fits whichever way the phone is held, and is drawn
  after the box, as in the original, so it stays legible when the box is at the
  top. Nothing moves by itself, so there is no timing. Colours are `[r g b a]`
  vectors. The draw method packs them with `rl/rgba`."
