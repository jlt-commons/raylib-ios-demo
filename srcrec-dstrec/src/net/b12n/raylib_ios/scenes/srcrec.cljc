  "Source and Destination Rects, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `srcrec-dstrec` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `srcrec_dstrec`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/srcrec_dstrec.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_srcrec_dstrec`: one frame of a sprite sheet drawn the way
  DrawTexturePro draws it. A source rectangle picks the frame, a destination
  rectangle scales it, and an origin offset makes it spin in place.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  Mirrored from srcrec_dstrec.clj:
  - The sheet (lines 32-42): six frames of 64 by 64 side by side, 384 by 64.
    Frame `(quot x 64)` takes its ground colour from RED, ORANGE, GOLD, GREEN,
    SKYBLUE, VIOLET in that order, and a disc of radius 64 * 0.32 about the
    frame's centre is RAYWHITE. `sheet-spec` packs it with `net.b12n.raylib-ios.texel/pack`,
    whose byte order is raylib-jlt's `rgba`.
  - The frame (lines 30, 96-100): `FRAME-SHOWN` is 3, so the source rectangle
    is the fourth frame, texcoords 192/384 to 256/384 across and 0 to 1 down.
  - The spin (lines 92, 101, 119): the rotation starts at 0 and grows 1.0 degree a
    frame, clockwise, about the middle of the destination rectangle (the
    original's origin of 64 64 in a 128 by 128 destination).
  - The crosshair (lines 102-111): a GRAY line through the middle each way.
  - The text (lines 112-117): \"srcrec picks the frame, dstrec scales it,
    origin spins it\".

  Deviations. The destination is a square of 0.32 of the screen's shorter side
  (the original's 128 of an 800 by 450 window is 0.28 of its height), so the
  scale is not a whole 2x. The vertical line starts below Back and the text sits
  under it. The first frame drawn has already turned one degree, because the
  gallery runs `update` before `draw`.

  Entry cost. The first open after launch pauses for about 0.2 s on the phone
  (the largest single frame, measured), while the texture's pixels are computed
  and uploaded. Opening it again takes about one frame, because the filled
  texture buffer is kept.

  The state holds `:rotation` and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
