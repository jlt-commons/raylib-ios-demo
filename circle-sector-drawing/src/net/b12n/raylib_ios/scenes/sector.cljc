(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.sector
  "A pie slice degrading into a triangle as its segment count falls. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `circle-sector-drawing` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `circle_sector_drawing`), itself raylib's
  `shapes_circle_sector_drawing.c`.

  The point of the example is a piece of arithmetic rather than a picture.
  raylib needs at least one segment per 90 degrees of arc to draw something that
  still reads as a curve, and when handed fewer it computes that floor itself as
  `ceil((end - start) / 90)`. Below the floor your number is ignored and the
  floor is used, which the original labels AUTO. At or above it, your number is
  what draws.

  The C drives all four values with raygui sliders and raylib-jlt swapped those
  for keys, neither of which a phone has. So the segment count sweeps on a timer
  instead, down from smooth to the floor and back, and the readout says which
  number is in force. The arithmetic being demonstrated is untouched, which is
  the part worth keeping."
