(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.minesweeper
  "Minesweeper, played by tap and long press. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `minesweeper` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `minesweeper`).

  The original reveals with a left click, flags with a right click and restarts
  on SPACE. Here a `:tap` from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` reveals the cell under the
  finger's START point, a `:long-press` toggles a flag there, and a `:tap`
  restarts after a mine or a win, unless it lands in the Back region, which is
  the host's. This is the first scene to use the long press. Once one has
  fired, `gesture/track` swallows the release, so flagging a cell never also
  reveals it.

  The rules are the original's: revealing a cell with no mine around it floods
  outward through every such cell and the numbered cells on their edge, a mine
  ends the game, and revealing every cell that is not a mine wins. Two quirks
  of the original are kept on purpose. Its reveal has no flag guard, so a tap
  on a flagged cell opens it (and a flagged mine ends the game); the flag stays
  in the set but is no longer drawn on an open cell. And there is no
  first-tap safety, so the first reveal can be a mine, as it can there.

  The original's board is 16 columns by 12 rows with 30 mines. A phone is
  usually held tall, so the grid is turned with the screen: 12 by 16 in
  portrait and 16 by 12 in landscape, with the same 30 mines. The cell is the
  largest whole number of pixels that fits the board between the Back region
  and a status line at the bottom, and the board is centred. A whole-pixel cell
  means two neighbours share an edge exactly, so a touch there lands in one
  cell only.

  The grid is laid out for one screen, so the state remembers its `:screen` and
  a rotation starts a new game, as Breakout's and Snake's do.

  The original places mines with `rl/get-random-value` and retries on a repeat.
  Here they come from the project's LCG, using the high bits, and the state
  carries the `:seed` so each new game differs.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
