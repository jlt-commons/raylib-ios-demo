(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.tesseract
  "A rotating 4D hypercube, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `tesseract-view` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `tesseract_view`).

  Sixteen vertices, every coordinate plus or minus one. Two are joined by an
  edge when they differ in exactly one coordinate, which gives 32 edges. It
  spins in two 4D planes at once, then projects 4D to 3D to 2D by perspective,
  so the inner cube appears to turn inside-out through the outer one.

  Inner cube red, outer cube blue, the eight edges joining them green. Nothing
  here is a special case: which cube an edge belongs to falls out of the sign of
  its endpoints' fourth coordinate.

  The cheapest scene in the gallery by a wide margin. 32 line segments a frame
  against the 1200 the Lorenz trail draws, so it holds the frame rate with the
  screen almost empty, which makes it the useful control when something else
  starts dropping frames.")
