  "A ball bouncing around the screen; tap to pause. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `bounce` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `bounce`).

  The original pauses on SPACE. Here a `:tap`, worked out by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture`
  from the whole touch, toggles the pause, so a finger that starts a swipe or
  rests for a long press never pauses it by accident. A tap that lands in the
  Back region is the host's, so it is ignored.

  The original is an 800x450 window with a 20 px ball moving 5 by 4 px a frame.
  Everything scales by `(min w h) / 450`, so the ball keeps its proportions and
  crosses the screen in about the same number of frames on a phone held either
  way up. Like the original this is frame-locked, one step per `advance`.

  The state remembers the `:screen` it was laid out for. When the phone rotates
  the ball is clamped into the new bounds, and keeps its heading and its pause.
  The speed scales with the shorter side, which a rotation leaves unchanged.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
