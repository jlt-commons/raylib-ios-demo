  "Balls under gravity, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `ball-physics` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `ball_physics`).

  Each ball carries a position, a velocity and a radius. Gravity is added to
  the vertical velocity every frame, and a wall reverses the relevant component
  and scales it by a restitution below one, so the bounces decay.

  The original respawns on SPACE. There is no keyboard here, so it watches the
  total energy instead: once every ball has settled it starts over. That is
  more interesting than a key anyway, because it means the scene shows the
  whole arc rather than whatever moment you happen to look at.

  Positions are in the safe region's own coordinates, which is why the floor is
  at its height rather than the screen's. See the safe-area guide."
