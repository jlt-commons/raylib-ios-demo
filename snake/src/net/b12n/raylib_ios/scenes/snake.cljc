(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.snake
  "The classic snake, steered by swipes. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `snake` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `snake`).

  The original steers with the arrow keys and restarts on SPACE. Here a
  `:swipe` from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` turns the snake, and a `:tap` restarts it after
  game over, unless the tap lands in the Back region, which is the host's.

  The rules are the original's: the snake moves one cell every `tick-frames`
  frames, grows by one cell when its head reaches the food, and the game ends
  when the head hits a wall or the snake's own body. A turn that would reverse
  the snake is refused. The original judges that against the direction last
  chosen, which is the one it also moves in, because a key press is a single
  frame. A swipe can arrive twice inside one tick, so the check here is against
  the direction the snake last MOVED in (`:heading`). Otherwise \"up\" then
  \"left\" while heading right would be accepted and the next step would run the
  head into the neck.

  The original's board is 32 columns by 18 rows. A phone is usually held tall,
  so the grid is turned with the screen: 18 by 32 in portrait and 32 by 18 in
  landscape. The cell is the largest square that fits the board above a score
  line, and the board is centred.

  The grid is laid out for one screen, so the state remembers its `:screen` and
  a rotation starts a new game, as Breakout's does.

  The original picks food with `rl/get-random-value` and retries while the cell
  is taken. Here the food comes from the project's LCG and chooses among the
  free cells, so it cannot loop on a crowded board.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
