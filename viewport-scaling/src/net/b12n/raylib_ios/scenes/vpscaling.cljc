(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.vpscaling
  "A game drawn at a fixed resolution and scaled into a window under six
  viewport policies. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `viewport-scaling` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `viewport-scaling`), which is
  raylib's `core_viewport_scaling` example (zlib licence).

  The original renders the game into a render texture of the game's size, in a
  resizable 800 by 450 window, and blits it to a destination rectangle that
  depends on the window and the policy. Two pairs of < > buttons step the game
  resolution (64x64, 256x240, 320x180, 3840x2160) and the policy (KEEP_ASPECT_INTEGER,
  KEEP_HEIGHT_INTEGER, KEEP_WIDTH_INTEGER, KEEP_ASPECT, KEEP_HEIGHT, KEEP_WIDTH). The
  game is a white clear with a LIME circle of radius 20 at the mouse, mapped back
  into game pixels. Six readouts report the window, the game, the policy, the
  scale ratio, the source size and the destination size.

  `rects` is the original's `compute-rects`, line for line: `keep-aspect-rects`
  (integer or not), `keep-height-rects` and `keep-width-rects`, with the original's
  quirks kept. The two height policies are one function and so are the two width
  policies, so the INTEGER variants of those do not snap: only KEEP_ASPECT_INTEGER
  does, with `quot`. `plan` and `game-point` use the same maths the original uses
  for the blit and for the mouse: the destination is `dx dy dw dh`, and a mouse
  at `mx my` in the window is `(mx - dx) * sw / dw` and `(my - dy) * sw / dw`
  (the original's `ratio-x` is used for both axes).

  Here the window is a virtual window inside the field, and its size is the
  window size the maths run on. Its top-left corner is fixed, a square handle in
  its bottom-right corner resizes it (see `advance`), and it is clamped between
  `:min-win` and `:max-win` from `geometry`. It starts at the original's 800 by
  450 shape, at 80 percent of the largest window the field allows in whichever
  direction runs out first, so the handle has room to grow it both ways. The
  render texture becomes a scissor on the destination rectangle and a push,
  translate and scale in the draw method (the destination's corner, then
  destination over source on each axis), which clips to the same edges the
  texture has.

  Controls here, in place of the original's window and mouse:
  - Dragging the handle resizes the window by exactly the finger's travel, from
    wherever on the handle it was grabbed. A touch
    that starts anywhere else in the screen, except on a button or under Back,
    is the mouse: the circle follows the finger while it is down and stays
    where the finger last was after it lifts, like a mouse that is left alone.
    It starts at the middle of the window. A finger that starts elsewhere and
    slides onto the handle does not resize.
  - The four < > buttons are taps (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture`) that began on them. < from
    the first wraps to the last. The default font has no arrow glyphs for the
    host to rely on, so the labels are the ASCII < and >.
  - The original's window readout is the virtual window's size, and every
    readout is one size, cut back until the widest it can be fits the width.

  Differences from the original, all disclosed in the catalog row:
  - The original draws its panel over the window, at (5, 5), with the two button
    pairs inside it. Here the six readouts are above the field and the two
    pairs of buttons flank the game and policy lines, so the readouts are in a
    different order from the original's (the game and policy lines first), and
    the panel's box is dropped.
  - A policy that gives an empty destination (an integer policy for a game
    bigger than the window, where the original's `quot` gives a ratio of 0)
    draws nothing and gives no mouse position, and the scale readout says
    INVALID as the original's does under 0.001. The original would make a
    zero-size render texture, which it cannot.
  - `fmt2` is `f2` below, since the project does not use `format`.

  The state holds numbers, keywords and vectors of numbers only: `:win`, `:res`
  and `:vtype`, `:mouse` in field pixels, `:grab` and its offset, `:screen` and
  the `:gesture`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
