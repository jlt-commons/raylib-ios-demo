(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.yawpitchroll
  "A plane built from boxes, flown with the three aircraft rotations. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `yaw-pitch-roll` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `yaw_pitch_roll`) (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (7, 5, 10) at the origin through a 45 degree
  perspective camera. It draws a grid of 12 sunk to y = -3, then a plane of five
  boxes inside rlPushMatrix/rlPopMatrix, turned by `rlRotatef(yaw, 0, 1, 0)`,
  `rlRotatef(pitch, 1, 0, 0)` and `rlRotatef(roll, 0, 0, 1)`, in that order.
  rlgl applies the last call to a vertex first, so a vertex rolls about z, then
  pitches about x, then yaws about y. `plane-transform` is
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/compose` of the three in the same order, and the test pins it
  with a vertex worked out apart from soft3d. The boxes (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s
  default is raylib-jlt's `cube!`), their sizes, their colours and the grid are
  the original's. The projection is in software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original's keys, and what stands in for each:
  - A and D yaw by +1.1 and -1.1 degrees a frame, W and S pitch by +0.9 and
    -0.9, Q and E roll by -1.3 and +1.3, each held to +-90. Q is tested before E,
    as the original's `cond` tests it, so both together roll -1.3.
  - A relative thumb-stick replaces A, D, W and S. The press point is its
    centre, and a finger that lands in the 3D area starts it. An axis is on when
    the finger is further than `gesture/slop` from the centre along it: left is
    A, right is D, up the glass is W and down is S. Each axis is its own dead
    zone and runs at its own rate, so a diagonal turns both, as two keys
    pressed together do. `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick` decides whose finger it is: a stick
    starts only on a finger that was not down the frame before, so a finger
    that was already down when the scene opened, or one that began under Back
    or on a button, never does, even when another finger lands. It follows
    only that finger, by touch id (by nearness when the host gives none), and
    ends when it lifts, and no resting finger takes it over. A finger that
    slides from the stick onto a button ends the stick.
  - Two held buttons replace Q and E. They are read from `:touch-points`, so a
    thumb on the stick and a thumb on a button act together. \"roll left\" is
    the original's E (+1.3, the left wing goes down) and \"roll right\" is Q
    (-1.3). They are named by what the plane does, which puts them the other
    way round from the keys' places.
  - Nothing else in the original reads input.

  An axis that is not being driven eases back as the original does, to 0.94 of
  its value a frame, and to 0 under 0.15 degrees. Nothing reads a frame time,
  like the original: every rate is per update.

  The original's gauges are kept: a label, a bar that grows out of the middle
  (full at 45 degrees), a tick at the middle and the angle in degrees, over a
  dark panel, and the line \"let go and each axis eases back to level\". The
  panel sits at the bottom of the screen with the two buttons inside it, so the
  3D area is the field between the title and the panel. The original's
  `%6.1f` is `value-text`, which does not pad. Its three gauges stand side by
  side in the panel, not stacked, so that the 3D area stays tall, and the
  original's `yaw   A / D` labels are just `yaw`, `pitch` and `roll`. All text is
  sized in `dimensions`, and the camera's fovy is the original's while the 3D
  area is as wide as 800x450 and widened by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a
  narrower one. A face with a corner behind the near plane is dropped whole.

  The state holds `:yaw`, `:pitch` and `:roll` in degrees, `:stick` (the
  centre and the finger, or nil), `:held` (the set of button ids held, for the
  draw), `:n` (the finger count last frame), `:pts` and `:ids` (the touch
  points and touch ids of that frame, for telling a new finger from one
  already down) and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."

  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d` sorts whole faces by mean depth, which cannot order a box
