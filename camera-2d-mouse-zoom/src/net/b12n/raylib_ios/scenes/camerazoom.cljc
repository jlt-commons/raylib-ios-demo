  "A 2D camera that zooms about the point you pin. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `camera-2d-mouse-zoom` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera-2d-mouse-zoom`), which is raylib's `core_2d_camera_mouse_zoom` example
  (zlib licence).

  The original draws a world of a 21x21 grid of 50-unit cells, a red square at
  the origin, a blue circle, a lime box and the text \"world origin\" through a
  Camera2D, with a crosshair at the cursor and two lines of text along the
  bottom. A left-drag pans by the mouse delta over the zoom. Key 1 zooms on the
  wheel and key 2 zooms by dragging with the right button, both after pinning
  the cursor, and both in log space, `exp(log(zoom) + k)`, clamped to 0.125 to
  64. The grid, the shapes, the colours, the crosshair and the clamp are the
  original's.

  Controls here:
  - A one-finger drag pans. Each `:down` frame moves the target by minus the
    finger's movement since the last frame, divided by the zoom, so the world
    point under the finger stays under it. The press frame only anchors the
    drag, and the release position is never read.
  - A two-finger pinch zooms, in place of the wheel and the right-drag. Modes 1
    and 2 are dropped: there is one zoom, so there is no mode to pick, and the
    HUD no longer names one. Each frame the camera is pinned (see
    `net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pin`) on the world point that was under the pinch's
    previous midpoint, its offset is moved to the midpoint now, and then the
    zoom becomes `exp(log(zoom) + log(ratio))`, where `ratio` is the change of
    finger distance (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pinch-step`). Held midpoint, that pins the
    point under it at any zoom, as the original does under the cursor. A midpoint
    that drifts drags the world with it, which the original's wheel could not.
    The twist of the fingers is ignored.

  A pinch and a pan never share a finger. A second finger landing ends the pan
  that frame, and with two or more fingers down only the pinch acts. A pinch
  acts only while the finger count stays at two (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pinch-frame`):
  a third finger landing, one of three lifting or a platform reorder of three
  points only records the new fingers and moves nothing. When one finger lifts,
  the one left pans nothing until a fresh press, and the next pair of fingers
  starts a pinch from its first frame with no jump. A touch that begins under Back pans nothing.

  The crosshair sits at the last touch, or the pinch's midpoint. The camera
  starts with the world origin at the field's centre, where the original starts
  it at the window's top-left, because a phone's top-left is under Back. The
  field is everything below Back and the text lines are drawn over it along the
  bottom, as in the original. Zoom is printed with three decimals by
  `zoom-label`, which needs no `format`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors. Nothing
  here reads a frame time, like the original."
