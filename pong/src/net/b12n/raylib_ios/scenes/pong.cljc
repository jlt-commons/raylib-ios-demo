(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.pong
  "Pong against a CPU, your paddle on a finger. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `pong` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `pong`).

  The original moves the left paddle with W and S and restarts on ENTER. Here
  the player's paddle follows the finger along the court's cross axis while one
  is on the glass (`:press` or `:down`), clamped to the court, and holds still
  otherwise. Nothing moves on `:release`, whose position is the last hardware
  value. After a win a `:tap` from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` restarts the game, unless it
  lands in the Back region, which belongs to the host.

  The rules are the original's: the ball bounces off the two side walls, a
  paddle returns it with english of `0.08` per pixel from the paddle's centre,
  the ball never speeds up, the CPU chases the ball at `AISPEED`, a ball past a
  paddle scores for the other side, and the first to 7 wins.

  The court is turned for the screen. The game logic stays in the original's own
  frame, a LONG axis (the original's x, along which the ball travels) and a
  CROSS axis (its y, along which paddles slide), and `orient` is the only place
  that maps it onto pixels. In landscape the long axis is screen x and the
  player is on the left, as in the original. On a tall phone it is screen y, the
  player is at the bottom and the CPU at the top, so the finger's x is the cross
  coordinate. The court starts below `gesture/back-region` either way.

  The 800x450 layout is scaled per axis: everything along the long axis by
  `L / 800`, everything along the cross axis by `C / 450`, so the ball takes
  about as many frames to cross the court as the original's does. The
  ball's speed is not capped: the paddle test is an overlap of ranges wider than
  one frame's step, so nothing tunnels.

  This is frame-locked, like the original: `advance` moves the ball a fixed
  distance per call, so the game runs faster on a 120 Hz display than on a 60 Hz
  one. The Delta Time scene shows why that matters. It is kept here because the
  point of the port is the original.

  The original draws serves with `rl/get-random-value`. Here they come from the
  project's LCG, taking its high bits, so the namespace stays pure.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors. The draw method packs them with `rl/rgba`."
