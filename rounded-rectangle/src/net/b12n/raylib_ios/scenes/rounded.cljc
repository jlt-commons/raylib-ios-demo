(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.rounded
  "A rectangle with quarter-circle corners, its radius breathing from square to
  fully round. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `rounded-rectangle` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rounded_rectangle`), itself raylib's
  `shapes_rounded_rectangle_drawing`.

  raylib's `DrawRectangleRounded` takes a Rectangle by value and cannot be bound
  here, so the shape is assembled: a cross of two rectangles covering the middle,
  plus four quarter disks at the corners. That decomposition is the example.

  The interesting part is the degenerate ends. At radius 0 the corner disks
  vanish and the cross has to be exactly the rectangle, with no seam. At the
  maximum, radius is half the shorter side and the two arms of the cross meet
  along a single line, so any rounding error shows as a gap. Both ends are
  tested, because both are where an off-by-one in the decomposition hides."

  extra fill and removes every chance of a seam."
