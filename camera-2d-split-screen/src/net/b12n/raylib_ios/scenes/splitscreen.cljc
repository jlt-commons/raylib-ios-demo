  "Two players on one shared grid, each in a half of the screen. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `camera-2d-split-screen` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera-2d-split-screen`), which is raylib's
  `core_2d_camera_split_screen` example (zlib licence).

  The original draws a 20 by 11 grid of 40-unit cells with a `[i,j]` label in
  each, and two 40-unit squares on it, player one red at (200, 200) and player
  two blue at (250, 200). Each player has a Camera2D whose offset is (200, 200)
  and whose target is that player, rendered into a 400 by 440 render texture.
  The two textures sit side by side with a 4 pixel divider between them. Each
  half has a banner (RAYWHITE at 60% alpha, 30 high) with 10 point text naming
  the keys. W, A, S, D move player one and the arrow keys move player two, 3
  units a frame, frame locked, and the players are not held inside the grid.

  Here the render textures become a scissor and a camera: each half is a
  scissored viewport drawn through `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/with-camera-2d`, and the same
  world is drawn once per half. The halves stack in portrait (player one on
  top) and sit side by side in landscape, picked by the field's aspect. The
  camera's offset is its viewport's centre and one base zoom fits the original's
  400 by 440 half into either shape. The labels and the banner text keep the
  original's size 10, so they are scaled by that zoom with the rest of the
  world, and the banner's text size is the original's 10 times the zoom.

  Controls here, in place of the two sets of keys:
  - A relative thumb-stick in each half. A touch point steers the half it lies
    in, from `:touch-points`, which carries no ids and no stable order, so a
    point is assigned by where it is. A half's stick starts on the frame a point
    first appears in that half when there was none there the frame before, and
    its centre is where that point was. While a point stays in the half it is
    the stick's finger. Inside `gesture/slop` of the centre there is no
    direction, so a tap never moves a player. Outside it the player moves the
    original's 3 units a frame along the normalised vector, so a diagonal is no
    faster (the keys add two axes, 4.24 a frame, the one deliberate
    difference). A stick ends when its half has no point.
  - Two thumbs work at once, one per half. If two points are in one half, the
    stick follows the one nearest its previous finger, but only when that is
    within `follow-bound` of it (two fifths of the half's shorter side). A
    nearest point farther than that is another finger, whether it replaced the
    thumb in one frame or the thumb lifted while it rested there. The old stick
    then ends and a fresh one starts on it, so the player stops and never
    reverses against the old centre. A fresh stick takes the lesser point by x
    then y so the order of `:touch-points` never matters.
  - A thumb that slides across the divider ends the stick it left, and starts a
    fresh one in the other half at the crossing, so nothing jumps. If that half
    already has a thumb, the stick keeps it unless the other point is the
    nearer one and within `follow-bound`.
  - A touch under `gesture/back-region` belongs to the host and is ignored, as
    if it were not there. Only `:touch-points` is read, so a release position
    never is. A rotation of the phone drops both sticks, whose pixels are the
    old screen's, and a finger held through it starts a fresh one where it now
    is, so nothing moves. This calls no `gesture/track`, since nothing here is a tap
    or a drag by itself.

  The original's banner texts name the keys, so they are replaced by
  \"PLAYER1: drag to move\" and \"PLAYER2: drag to move\", and their size shrinks
  when a banner would not fit its half. Nothing here reads a frame time, like
  the original. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
