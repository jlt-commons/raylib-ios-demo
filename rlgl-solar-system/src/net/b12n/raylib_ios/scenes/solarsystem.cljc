(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.solarsystem
  "A sun, an Earth and a Moon through nested transforms, ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `rlgl-solar-system` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rlgl_solar_system`) (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (16, 16, 16) at the origin through a 45 degree
  perspective camera and draws three cubes: a gold one of side 3 at the origin,
  a blue one of side 1.4 and a light gray one of side 0.7. With the angles
  `earth-orbit = (mod (* 0.5 frame) 360)`, `earth-spin = (mod frame 360)` and
  `moon-orbit = (mod (* 2 frame) 360)` in degrees, it calls

      rlPushMatrix; rlRotatef(earth-orbit, 0, 1, 0); rlTranslatef(9, 0, 0)
        rlPushMatrix; rlRotatef(earth-spin, 0, 1, 0); <the Earth>; rlPopMatrix
        rlRotatef(moon-orbit, 0, 1, 0); rlTranslatef(2.6, 0, 0); <the Moon>
      rlPopMatrix

  rlgl applies the last call first, so each is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/compose` of the
  same calls in the same order. The Earth is the orbit, the translate and the
  spin. The Moon is the orbit and translate of the Earth, then its own orbit
  and translate, without the Earth's spin. The Sun has no transform. Cubes take
  raylib-jlt's `cube!` shades (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default). Nothing reads a
  frame time, like the original: the angles advance by frame.

  There is no input and so no control to map. The original's caption is kept.
  It sits below Back, with the 3D view in the field under it, full width to the
  bottom, clipped to it by the draw method. The original's fovy is kept while
  the field is at least as wide as 800x450, and in a narrower field
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it so the original's horizontal view still
  fits. The original draws no grid, so there are no lines. A frame is at most
  three cubes, 18 triangles when none is turned and a few more as they turn;
  the Earth passing behind the Sun is ordered by mean depth, with no depth
  buffer.

  The state holds only `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
