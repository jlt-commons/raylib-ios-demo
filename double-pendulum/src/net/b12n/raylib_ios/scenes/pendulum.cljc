(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.pendulum
  "A chaotic double pendulum, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `double-pendulum` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `double_pendulum`).

  Two rods, the standard Lagrangian equations of motion, and a fading trail of
  where the second bob has been. Sensitive to its initial conditions, which is
  the point: the same seed always draws the same curve, and a hair's difference
  would not.

  Pure, and the integrator is the original's verbatim. What changed is that the
  geometry derives from the live screen instead of a fixed 800x450, and the
  loop belongs to the host.")
