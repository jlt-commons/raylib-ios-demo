(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.sequence
  "A shuffled sequence of bars, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `random-sequence` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `random_sequence`).

  The example upstream is about `LoadRandomSequence`, which hands back each
  value in a range exactly once in a random order. That is a different thing
  from `GetRandomValue`, which samples WITH replacement: calling it n times
  gives duplicates and gaps, so the bars would not be a permutation and a
  reshuffle would change the set rather than only its order.

  So this shuffles rather than redraws. Every height appears exactly once, and
  reshuffling moves the bars without changing which heights exist. Watch a
  colour travel rather than change, which is the property the whole example is
  demonstrating and is invisible in a still picture.

  The shuffle is a seeded Fisher-Yates over the same LCG the other scenes use,
  not `clojure.core/shuffle`. Two reasons: a scene should replay identically,
  and a test cannot say much about a shuffle it cannot reproduce."

  Walks from the end and swaps each element with one at or before it, which is

  biased shuffle that looks fine."
