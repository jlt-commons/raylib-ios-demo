  "Top Down Lights, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `top-down-lights` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `top_down_lights`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/top_down_lights.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `shapes_top_down_lights` by Jeffery Myers (zlib). This is an altered version of
  both.

  Nothing here draws light. Every light renders a full-field mask whose ALPHA is
  all that matters, the masks are merged into one, and that one is drawn over the
  ground as black: alpha 0 reads as lit, alpha 1 as dark. Two custom blend
  equations do the merging. GL_MIN keeps the smaller of source and destination,
  so a light's gradient punches its transparent centre into a mask cleared to
  opaque white, and the master mask keeps the brightest light at each pixel.
  GL_MAX keeps the larger, so a shadow quad at alpha 1 cuts itself back out of
  the disc. Both ignore the factors, which is why the same SRC_ALPHA pair goes to
  each.

  Mirrored from top_down_lights.clj:
  - The constants (lines 34-38): `max-lights` 16, `n-boxes` 20 and `tile` 64.
  - The boxes (lines 179-197): two placed by hand, (150, 80) and (500, 350), each
    40 square, then 18 more with x in 0 to W, y in 0 to H and w and h in 10 to
    100, drawn in that order from the project LCG in place of GetRandomValue.
  - The shadows (lines 61-101): `shadow-quad`, `box-shadows`, `overlaps?` and
    `inside?` as written, so each box casts one quad for every edge the light is
    outside of, plus its own footprint, and a light inside a box goes dark.
  - The mask (lines 103-124): clear to WHITE, then the blend with GL_SRC_ALPHA,
    GL_SRC_ALPHA and GL_MIN around the light's gradient (clear at the centre,
    WHITE at the rim), then GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_SRC_ALPHA and GL_MAX around the
    shadow quads in WHITE. `mask-plan` is that sequence.
  - The master (lines 141-157): clear to BLACK, then GL_MIN around every mask
    drawn full size. `master-plan`.
  - The lights (lines 159-169, 220, 239): light 1 has radius 300 and starts at
    (600, 400), the others have 200, up to 16.
  - The idle light (lines 171-177): until it is dragged, light 1 walks
    (W/2 + 0.34 W sin t, H/2 + 0.30 H sin 2t) with t = 0.012 a frame.
  - The picture (lines 254-309): the checkered ground repeated over the field,
    the master over it (in a 191 alpha tint while the volumes show), a circle of
    radius 10 on every light (YELLOW for light 1, WHITE for the rest), the
    volumes (light 1's shadow quads in DARKPURPLE, the boxes it can reach in
    PURPLE, every box outlined in DARKBLUE) and the three texts.
  - The ground (lines 207-213): 64 square, DARKBROWN where the x and y halves
    agree and DARKGRAY where they do not.

  Inputs. The mouse becomes touch. A finger that lands in the field and travels
  past the tap slop drags light 1, which then stays where it is left. A quick
  touch that does not travel adds a light there (the right button), up to 16.
  A button toggles the shadow volumes (F1).

  Deviations.
  - **The field, not an 800 by 450 window.** Positions are the original's
    fractions of the field, and every length (the boxes, the radii, the tile,
    the markers) is scaled by the smaller of field width over 800 and field
    height over 450, so the world fills the field and the light reaches as far,
    in proportion. Each mask and the master are the size of the field.
  - **The texts.** \"drag to move light #1\", \"tap to add a new light\" (the
    original says right click) and the button's own label in place of
    \"(F1) show shadow volumes\". Their sizes are the original's 10 times the
    scale, raised to 24 so a phone can read them, and spaced to fit.
  - **Dropped.** The FPS counter.
  - **A light standing inside a box** goes dark, as in raylib-jlt's port (the C
    returns early and leaves the last mask up).
  - **A turn** resets the lights, since positions are in field pixels.

  The state holds `:lights` (`{:pos :radius :valid? :shadows}`), `:dirty` (the
  indices whose mask must be redrawn THIS frame and nothing older; the master is
  merged when it is not empty), `:release` (the indices of masks to give back
  this frame), `:boxes`, `:steered?`, `:show?`, `:gesture`,
  `:frame` and the `:screen` it was laid out for. Colours are `[r g b a]`
  vectors."
