  "Sprite stacking, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `sprite-stacking` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `sprite_stacking`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/sprite_stacking.clj, zlib licence): forty top-down slices
  of a small car, each drawn at the same rotation and a little higher on the
  screen than the one below, which the eye reads as a solid body turning in place.

  The original paints the slices into one 56 by 784 image with `image-draw-
  rectangle!` and `image-draw-circle!` (lines 38-76) and draws each as a
  textured quad. There is no image here. `layer-shapes` is those calls, kept as
  data: `[:rect x y w h colour]` and `[:circle cx cy r colour]` in the slice's
  56 by 28 pixels. Each is drawn directly, rotated with its slice.
  - `slab` (lines 38-47): a rounded rectangle as two rects, one inset by `r` at
    the sides and one at the top and bottom, and four circles of radius `r` on
    its corners. The corner circles are centred on the integer corner, so they
    touch the rects' edges as the raster circles do.
  - `draw-layer` (lines 49-71), with `t = i / 39`: from `t >= 0.88` two black
    11 by 28 wheels at x 8 and 38; from 0.55 the body (2, 1, 52, 26, r 3) in RED;
    from 0.30 the shoulders (5, 2, 46, 24, r 3) in RED; otherwise the cabin (10,
    3, 26, 22, r 3) in MAROON, with a SKYBLUE glass (13, 6, 20, 16, r 2) while
    `t < 0.15`. That is 5 wheel slices, 13 body, 10 shoulders and 12 cabin
    slices, glass on the top 6.
  - The draw loop (lines 112-124): slices from the last row to the first, so row
    0, the roof, lands on top. Slice `i` is centred on x = the middle and
    y = the middle + `i * spacing - spacing * 40 / 2`, scaled 3x (`stack-scale`),
    and turned by the rotation about its own centre.
  - The state (lines 99-111): rotation in degrees, a spin speed of 30 degrees a
    second, and a spacing of 3.2. Each frame the rotation grows by
    `speed * frame-time` after the speed has been changed by the keys.

  Controls here:
  - A horizontal drag replaces the arrow keys and A and D. It is a relative
    stick: the press point is the centre, and while the finger is down further
    than `gesture/slop` to the right of it the speed grows by 0.35 a frame, to
    the left it falls by 0.35, as the keys did (lines 103-109, frame locked, no
    cap). Inside the slop, or only drifting up or down, nothing changes, so a tap
    spins nothing. A press under Back starts no stick.
  - A two-finger pinch replaces the mouse wheel. The original adds 0.1 a notch to
    the spacing, held to 0 to 5. Here the spacing grows by `pinch-gain` times the
    change of the fingers' distance minus one (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pinch-step`, so
    the order of the two never matters), held to the same 0 to 5. It is additive
    so that a spacing of 0 can open again. It acts only while exactly two fingers
    stay down (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pinch-frame`), and two fingers end a drag.

  The slices are scaled by `k`, the smaller of the safe region's width over 800
  and the field's height over 450, and centred on the field. The original's
  texts are kept (lines 125-135) with the controls named for a phone, and the
  caption at the bottom says what the slices are now made of. The state holds
  numbers only."
