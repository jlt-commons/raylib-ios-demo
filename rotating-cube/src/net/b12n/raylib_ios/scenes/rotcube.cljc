(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.rotcube
  "A cube turning in place, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `rotating-cube` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rotating_cube`), which is
  raylib's rlgl matrix-stack demonstration (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (4, 4, 4) at the origin through a 45 degree
  perspective camera, draws a grid of 10 and then a red cube of side 2 inside
  rlPushMatrix/rlPopMatrix, after `rlRotatef(angle, 1, 0, 0)` and
  `rlRotatef(angle * 0.7, 0, 1, 0)`, where the angle is the frame number in
  degrees. Here the same two turns are `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/compose` of two
  `rotate-axis` calls in the same order, so as in rlgl the y turn applies to the
  cube first. The camera, the grid, the cube, its colour and its shading
  (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default is raylib-jlt's `cube!`) are the original's.
  Nothing reads a frame time, like the original: the angle grows one degree an
  update.

  There is no input and so no control to map. The original's caption sits below
  Back, with the 3D view in the field under it, full width to the bottom. The
  view is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`'s `[x y w h]` viewport on that field. The original's
  45 degree fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide as 800x450. In a
  narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it so the original's
  horizontal view still fits, and the field shows more above and below.

  The grid is drawn under every face (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` puts all grid
  lines first). The cube is centred on y = 0, so half of it is below the grid,
  and where raylib's depth buffer would show grid lines in front of its lower
  half they are hidden here. Splitting the cube at the grid is follow-up work.

  The grid never changes, so `grid-list` builds it once per layout and
  `scene-list` adds the cube to a copy each frame. The state holds only
  `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
