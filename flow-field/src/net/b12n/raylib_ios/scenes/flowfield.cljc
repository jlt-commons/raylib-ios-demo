  "Particles following a Perlin-ish flow field, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `flow-field` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `flow_field`).

  Each particle reads an angle from a field of sines and cosines that drifts
  with time, steps along it, and drags a short trail. Wrapping at an edge clears
  the trail so it does not draw a line across the screen.

  THIS IS THE FIRST PORT WHERE THE BUDGET BIT. The original flies 500 particles
  with 16-point trails, which is up to 8000 line segments a frame, roughly eight
  times what docs/guide/performance-on-a-phone.md establishes as comfortable.
  Cut to 90 particles with 8-point trails it holds 54 fps, and the count is a
  plain def so the ceiling can be found again on other hardware without a
  rebuild.

  Two rounds of tuning, both from the same lesson. The first was the draw loop
  recomputing each particle's field angle for its colour when the step had just
  computed it: carrying the angle on the particle took 130 particles from 32 fps
  to 39. The rest is the stepping itself, which is why the count came down.")
