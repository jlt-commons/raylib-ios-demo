(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.easingstestbed
  "One easing curve at a time, plotted with a ball running along it. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `easings-testbed` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `easings_testbed`), which is raylib's `shapes_easings_testbed`
  example. A curve alone is hard to judge, because elastic and back leave the
  [0,1] band, which a plot shows and a number does not, and bounce and elastic
  feel alike in words and nothing alike in motion.

  The original uses RIGHT and LEFT to change curve, SPACE to replay and D to
  toggle the plot. Here a horizontal swipe from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` changes the
  curve (right is next, left is previous, wrapping at both ends), a `:tap`
  replays and a `:long-press` toggles the plot. A touch that starts in the Back
  region belongs to the host and is ignored. A vertical swipe does nothing.

  Timing is frame-locked, as in the original: it counts frames and never reads a
  clock, so `advance` reads no `:delta-seconds`. A run is `duration` frames,
  then the ball waits at the end until 1.6 times that, then it loops.

  The curves are the original's fifteen, in its order, which is the names
  sorted, taken from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.easings`. The plot samples the curve at
  `plot-samples` points and joins them with line segments, since the original's
  RL_LINES batch is not bound. The frame round the [0,1] band is four lines for
  the same reason.

  The original's plot is 600 by 220 in an 800 by 450 window, and the ball runs
  past the window's edge on the overshooting curves. Here everything is in the
  safe region below Back and must stay inside the screen. The two overshooting
  curves leave the band by at most `overshoot` of its size (elastic-out above by
  0.3729, elastic-in below by the same), both ways, so the band is narrowed to
  leave `overshoot` of its width at each side for the ball and of its height
  above and below for the plot. A test checks every curve against that.
  Everything is derived from the screen every frame, so a rotation needs no
  reset. Text is laid out in `dimensions` with widths estimated at 0.6 of the
  size per character."
