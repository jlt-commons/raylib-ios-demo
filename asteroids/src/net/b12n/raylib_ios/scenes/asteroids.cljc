  "Asteroids with four on-screen buttons. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `asteroids` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `asteroids`).

  The original rotates with LEFT and RIGHT, thrusts with UP, fires with SPACE
  and restarts with ENTER. Here four buttons sit along the bottom band, in the
  order rotate left, rotate right, thrust and fire. A button is held while ANY
  point in the input's `:touch-points` lies inside its rect, so one thumb can
  hold thrust while the other rotates, which the single `:pointer` could not
  say. A tap on the field outside the buttons and outside `gesture/back-region`
  restarts after game over, so a fire press after dying does not restart.

  The rules are the original's: ROT 0.07 a frame, THRUST 0.15, FRICTION 0.99,
  bullets that live 55 frames, asteroids of three sizes that split in two until
  the smallest is gone, waves of 4 plus one per 500 points, three lives and 90
  frames of blinking invulnerability after a crash. Its fire rule is a SPACE
  PRESS, an edge with no cooldown: holding the key fires once. Here a press
  fires at once too, but a held fire button keeps firing every `fire-every`
  frames, so a thumb can rest on it instead of mashing. Bullets expire by their
  life, so the count stays bounded whether the button is held or mashed.

  The 800x450 game is scaled into the play field, the area below
  `gesture/back-region` and above the buttons, and it wraps there. Thrust makes
  the ship go where it points, so the speeds cannot be scaled by a different
  factor per axis without bending that, and one factor `:u`, the geometric mean
  of the two axes' scales, applies to every radius, speed and acceleration. Pace
  therefore lands between the original's across and down. A bullet's speed plus
  the ship's top speed stays below the smallest asteroid's diameter at any
  scale, so the point test cannot skip it unless the rock is closing too. As in
  the original, a skip needs a near head-on pass at the rock's own top speed,
  which adds about 25u of closing speed against a 22u diameter (see the test
  that pins the inequality).

  This is frame-locked, like the original: `advance` moves everything a fixed
  distance per call, so the game runs faster on a 120 Hz display than on a 60 Hz
  one. The Delta Time scene shows why that matters. It is kept here because the
  point of the port is the original. A rotation starts a new game, since every
  position is in the old screen's pixels.

  Asteroids come from the project's LCG, taking its high bits. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors. The draw method packs them with `rl/rgba`."
