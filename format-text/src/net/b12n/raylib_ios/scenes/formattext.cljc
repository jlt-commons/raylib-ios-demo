  "A zero-padded score and an MM:SS timer counting up. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `format-text` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `format_text`).

  The score gains 7 a frame and the timer reads frames at 60 to the second.
  The timer has no hours field, as in the original, so it keeps counting
  minutes past 59.

  This port pads with a private `zero-pad` function instead of
  clojure.core/format, because the linter also reads this .cljc as cljs,
  where `format` does not exist.")
