(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.hilbert
  "A Hilbert space-filling curve, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `hilbert-curve` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `hilbert_curve`).

  The classic four-way recursion, drawn as one continuous rainbow line. Order 5
  is 1024 points, so 1023 segments a frame.

  The curve never changes, so it and its colours are computed ONCE at init.
  That matters here more than it would elsewhere: the original recomputes each
  segment's colour inline with three sin calls, which at 1023 segments is 3069
  transcendentals a frame on an interpreter, for a picture that is identical
  every time. See docs/guide/performance-on-a-phone.md.")
