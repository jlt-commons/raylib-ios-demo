  "A Penrose P3 tiling by deflation, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `penrose-tiling` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `penrose_tiling`).

  Ten Robinson triangles around a decagon, subdivided `deflations` times by the
  golden ratio. The tiling is computed ONCE at init and never changes, so this
  scene costs nothing per frame in Clojure and everything per frame in draw
  calls, which makes it the opposite stress test to boids.

  That matters on a phone. Each deflation multiplies the triangle count by
  about 2.6, and every triangle is four rlgl calls to fill plus three lines for
  its edges. Five deflations is roughly 1500 triangles, so about 6000 fill
  calls and 4500 line calls a frame, every one of them crossing libffi. So
  `default-deflations` is lower here than the original's 5 and `tiling` takes
  the count, which means it can be tuned live over the nREPL.")
