(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.camera3d
  "An orbiting 3D camera, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `camera-3d` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera_3d`), which is
  raylib's `core_3d_camera_mode` family (zlib licence).

  The original circles a perspective camera round a red cube of side 2 standing
  at (0, 1, 0) on a grid of 20. The camera is at radius 12 and height 8, its
  angle grows 0.02 radians a frame from 0, it looks at (0, 1, 0) with fovy 45.
  All of those are the original's. The cube is shaded face by face as
  raylib-jlt's `cube!` does it (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default).

  There is no input and so no control to map. Nothing reads a frame time, like
  the original: the orbit advances one step an update. The original's caption is
  kept and sits below Back, with the 3D view in the field under it, full width
  to the bottom. The view is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`'s `[x y w h]` viewport on that
  field. The original's fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide as
  800x450. In a narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it so the
  original's horizontal view still fits. The grid reaches past the field's
  edges, so the draw method clips to the field.

  The camera moves, so the grid is projected afresh each frame: 42 lines. The
  state holds only `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
