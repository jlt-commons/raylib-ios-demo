(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.freecam
  "A free 3D camera on two thumbs, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `camera-3d-free` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera_3d_free`),
  which is raylib's `core_3d_camera_free` example (zlib licence).

  The original lets raylib's own `UpdateCamera(CAMERA_FREE)` fly a camera round
  a red cube of side 2 at the origin, drawn with `DrawCube`, `DrawCubeWires` in
  maroon and a grid of 10. The camera starts at (10, 10, 10), looking at the
  origin, up (0, 1, 0), fovy 45. Here that camera is rebuilt in pure Clojure
  over a map `{:position :target :up :fovy :projection}`, and the scene is
  projected in software by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`. The rcamera.h functions mirrored
  are `GetCameraForward`, `GetCameraUp`, `GetCameraRight`, `CameraMoveForward`,
  `CameraMoveRight`, `CameraMoveToTarget`, `CameraYaw` and `CameraPitch`, each
  cited at its definition, with raymath.h's `Vector3RotateByAxisAngle`,
  `Vector3Angle` and `Vector3Normalize` under them. CAMERA_FREE fixes their
  flags (`moveInWorldPlane` false, `rotateAroundTarget` false, `lockView`
  true, `rotateUp` false), so they are fixed here too.

  Controls here, with `UpdateCamera`'s order kept (look, then move, then zoom):
  - A drag that starts in the upper two thirds of the field looks around, in
    place of the mouse delta. Each pixel turns the view 0.003 radians
    (`CAMERA_MOUSE_MOVE_SENSITIVITY`), yaw first and then pitch, times
    `800 / field width` so that a drag across the glass turns as far as one
    across the original's 800 pixel window. Pitch stops 0.001 radians short of
    straight up or down, as `lockView` does.
  - A relative thumb-stick that starts in the lower third replaces W, A, S and
    D. The press point is its centre. Further than `gesture/slop` from it, the
    camera moves that way along its view (up the glass is forward) at
    `CAMERA_MOVE_SPEED` 5.4 units a second times `:delta-seconds`, the vector
    normalised, so one speed in every direction. The original's keys add, which
    makes a diagonal faster, and that is the one deliberate difference.
  - Two fingers that are both in the upper two thirds pinch to dolly, in place
    of the wheel's `CameraMoveToTarget(-wheel)`. The camera moves along its
    view by `distance * (1 / ratio - 1)` where `ratio` is how much the fingers'
    distance changed, so spreading them to twice the distance halves the
    camera's distance from the target. It never reaches zero
    (`CameraMoveToTarget` holds 0.001). Two fingers in different regions are
    look and stick, not a pinch, and the stick finger stays the stick if it
    drifts up into the look region. A second finger landing high while a stick
    is held is a second look, never a pinch.
  - The pinch rule is the shared one (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pinch-frame`): it acts
    only while exactly two fingers stay down, and any change of finger count
    only records. A third finger ends everything.
  - A \"reset\" button below Back replaces Z, which in the original only sets
    the camera's target to (0, 0, 0). So does the button: the position and up
    stay where they are. A tap that ends a multi-finger touch is not a press on
    it.

  Dropped, because a phone has nothing to map them to: the cursor lock and
  unlock (`DisableCursor`), the arrow keys that turn the camera, Q and E that
  roll it, Space and Control that lift and lower it, the middle mouse pan, the
  gamepad and the keypad plus and minus. The original never lists most of
  them, but `UpdateCamera` reads them all. The wheel's pan, which the original
  does list, goes with the middle mouse button.

  Faces with a corner behind the near plane are dropped whole, a known limit
  of `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`. Flying into the cube makes its faces vanish rather than
  clip. Lines (the grid and the wires) are clipped to the near plane.

  The grid is drawn under every face (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` puts all grid
  lines first). The cube is centred on y = 0, so half of it is below the grid,
  and where raylib's depth buffer would show grid lines in front of its lower
  half they are hidden here. Splitting the cube at the grid is follow-up work.

  The HUD box of the original (a translucent rect, its outline and four lines
  of help text, at (10, 10) of an 800x450 window) is kept, its text changed to
  the touch controls, sized in `dimensions` and drawn in the top left of the
  field. The reset button sits in the row below Back, above the field.
  The original's 45 degree fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide as
  800x450, and widened by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a narrower one.

  A look or a stick follows only its own finger, by touch id (by nearness
  when the host gives none, `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick/follow`). When that finger lifts it
  ends, and a finger resting on the reset button or elsewhere is not taken in
  its place.

  The state holds the `:camera` and the finger tracking: `:look`, `:stick`,
  `:pinch`, `:n` (the finger count last frame), `:pts` and `:ids` (that
  frame's touch points and ids), `:gesture` for the button's tap and
  `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
