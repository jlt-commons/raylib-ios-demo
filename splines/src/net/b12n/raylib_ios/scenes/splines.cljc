  "Three spline bases over the same five control points. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `splines` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `splines`), itself raylib's `shapes_splines_drawing` minus its raygui controls.

  raylib's own `DrawSpline*` take Vector2 arrays by value, which nothing here can
  bind, so the curve is evaluated in Clojure and drawn as a polyline. That turns
  out to be the better version for showing what the example is about, because the
  three bases can then be drawn over each other from identical control points.

  Catmull-Rom passes through its control points. The cubic Bezier and the uniform
  B-spline do not, and the B-spline stays furthest away. Seeing that is the whole
  lesson, and it only reads if the three share their points, which is why the
  original cycles between them with SPACE and this draws all three at once. A
  phone has no SPACE, and the comparison is stronger anyway."
