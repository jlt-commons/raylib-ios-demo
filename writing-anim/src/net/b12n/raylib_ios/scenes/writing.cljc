  "A message that types itself, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `writing-anim` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `writing_anim`).

  A growing prefix of a string, driven by the frame counter, with a pause at
  the end before it starts over. That is the whole scene, and it is here
  because it is the only one that animates text rather than geometry.

  The pause matters more than it looks. Without it the message completes and
  restarts on consecutive frames, so the finished sentence is never on screen
  long enough to read, which defeats the point of a scene about writing."
