  "Fourier epicycles drawing a square wave, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `fourier-epicycles` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `fourier_epicycles`).

  A chain of circles, each turning at an odd harmonic with amplitude 4/(pi k),
  whose end traces the square wave those harmonics sum to. Watching the chain
  is watching a Fourier series converge.

  ROTATED FOR A PHONE, which is the interesting part of this port. The original
  is landscape: the epicycles sit on the left and the trace scrolls rightward
  across the remaining width. A phone is 1206 wide and 2622 tall, so there is
  no horizontal room for a scrolling wave and plenty of vertical. Here the
  chain hangs near the top and the wave scrolls DOWN, which is the same picture
  through ninety degrees. The maths is untouched: only which axis carries time
  has changed.")
