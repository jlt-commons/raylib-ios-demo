(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.fontsizes
  "Lines at several font sizes and colours, two of them centred by measuring
  them. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `text` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `text`), which uses raylib's built-in bitmap
  font and no external one.

  It differs from `align`, which is about where a word sits in a box (left,
  centre, right) and changes as it runs. This one is about size: the same kind
  of line at 10, 20, 30 and 40 in the original, plus a centred title and a
  centred footer. Nothing moves and no input is read.

  The original's window is 800 by 450 and its sizes are 10, 20, 30 and 40.
  Everything is scaled by one factor `u`, the smaller of the width over 800 and
  the room below Back over the original's 384 pixels of content, so the sizes
  keep their ratios and the whole block fits. Sizes are rounded to whole
  numbers, because raylib's default font is a bitmap that is scaled to any other
  size and an int is all `draw-text` takes. The block is offset from the top of
  the region below Back, not from the top of the screen.

  Centring depends on the width of a line, which a pure namespace cannot ask
  raylib for. `layout` takes a `measure` function `(fn [s size] -> px)`. The
  draw method passes the real one and the tests pass an estimate of 0.6 of the
  size per character. Text is laid out in `dimensions`."
