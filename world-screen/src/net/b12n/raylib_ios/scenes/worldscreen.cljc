(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.worldscreen
  "A 2D label pinned above a 3D cube, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `world-screen` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `world_screen`),
  which is raylib's `core_world_screen` (zlib licence).

  The original orbits a perspective camera round a red cube of side 2 at the
  origin on a grid of 10. The camera is at radius 14.14 and height 10, its angle
  starts at 0.7854 radians and grows by `0.3 * get-frame-time` a frame, it looks
  at the origin with fovy 45. Each frame it projects the world point (0, 2.5, 0)
  with GetWorldToScreen, truncates the result to whole pixels, and draws
  \"Enemy: 100/100\" with its top edge at that y and its centre at that x, found
  from the text's width. Here the angle grows by `0.3 * :delta-seconds`, the
  point goes through `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/world->screen` with the same view-proj the
  cube is drawn with, and the injected `measure` gives the width.

  There is no input and so no control to map. The original draws two more lines
  of text at the top left, over the 3D view: \"Cube screen position: [x, y]\"
  and \"Text 2D always stays on top of the cube\". The second is the caption
  here, below Back and above the field. The first is drawn at the field's top
  left, over the view, as in the original. The 3D view is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`'s
  `[x y w h]` viewport on the field, which runs full width to the bottom. The
  original's 45 degree fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide as
  800x450. In a narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it so the
  original's horizontal view still fits. All text uses the field's text size,
  where the original uses 20, so the readout and the label scale with the phone.

  The grid is drawn under every face (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` puts all grid
  lines first). The cube is centred on y = 0, so half of it is below the grid,
  and where raylib's depth buffer would show grid lines in front of its lower
  half they are hidden here. Splitting the cube at the grid is follow-up work.

  The camera moves, so the grid is projected afresh each frame: 22 lines. The
  state holds only `:t`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
