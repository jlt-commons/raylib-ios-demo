  "A cube walked across a grid, and the boxes it touches turn red. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `box-collisions` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `box_collisions`) (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (11, 12, 11) at (0, 0.5, 0) through a 45 degree
  perspective camera. It draws a grid of 20, then five static boxes standing on
  the ground, then the lime player cube of side 2 at (px, 1, pz), each drawn by
  `cube!` (so `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default shading). A box is red while the
  player overlaps it and gray otherwise. The test is a 3D AABB overlap of which
  only x and z are tested, since everything stands on the ground:
  `|px - x| < 1 + s/2` and `|pz - z| < 1 + s/2`, both strict. It draws no sphere
  and nothing moves by itself. The projection is in software, by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original's keys, and what stands in for each:
  - D and A add and subtract 0.18 on x a frame, S and W add and subtract 0.18 on
    z. The original's keys are each their own axis, so its diagonal moves 0.18
    on both, which is about 1.41 times as fast. The stick keeps one speed
    instead, as nudge, splitscreen and freecam do: a diagonal scales both axes
    by 1 / sqrt 2 (`diagonal`), and that is the one deliberate difference.
    Nothing is held to the grid: the player can leave it.
  - A relative thumb-stick replaces the four keys. The press point is its
    centre, and a finger that lands in the 3D area starts it. An axis is on
    when the finger is further than `gesture/slop` from the centre along it:
    left is A, right is D, up the glass is W (world -z, forward) and down is S.
    `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick` decides whose finger it is: a stick starts only on a finger
    that was not down the frame before, so a finger that was already down when
    the scene opened, or one that began under Back or above the 3D area, never
    does, even when another finger lands. It follows only that finger, by touch
    id (by nearness when the host gives none), and ends when it lifts, even if
    another is down. A rotation of the phone drops it. A tap moves nothing.
  - Nothing else in the original reads input.

  The painter orders whole boxes, face by face, so while the player overlaps a
  box one of the player's faces can paint over a face of that box where a depth
  buffer would sort them per pixel. The box is red then, and this is a known
  limit of `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  Nothing reads a frame time, like the original: the speed is per update. The
  original's text line at the top is kept as a caption below Back: its
  \"COLLISION!\" while the player overlaps a box, and \"drag to move the
  player\" where the original says \"WASD move the player\". Both are measured
  in `dimensions` so the wider fits. The camera's fovy is the original's while the
  3D area is as wide as 800x450 and widened by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a
  narrower one. A face with a corner behind the near plane is dropped whole.

  The state holds `:px` and `:pz`, `:stick` (the centre and the finger, or nil),
  `:n` (the finger count last frame), `:pts` and `:ids` (the touch points and
  touch ids of that frame, for telling a new finger from one already down) and
  `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
