  "Sprite Button, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `sprite-button` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `sprite_button`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/sprite_button.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_sprite_button`: one texture holds three stacked frames of a button,
  normal, hover and pressed, and the button picks its frame by sliding a window
  down the sheet, a third of the texture's height at a time. Click it and the
  counter goes up.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  Mirrored from sprite_button.clj:
  - The sheet (lines 33-62): 160 by 144, three frames of 160 by 48 stacked
    (lines 29-31). Frame 0 is [70 110 190], 1 is [95 150 235], 2 is [55 85 150];
    an edge band darkens the rim and lights the top (the bottom in frame 2), and
    a pale bar for a label sits a pixel lower in frame 2. `sheet-spec` packs it
    with `net.b12n.raylib-ios.texel/pack`, whose byte order is raylib-jlt's `rgba`.
  - The frame (lines 64-70, 99-100): 0 normal, 1 hover, 2 pressed, and the
    button's source window is `v0 = frame / 3` to `v1 = (frame + 1) / 3`.
  - The action (lines 96-97): a release over the button adds one to the click
    count. The original does not look at where the press began, and neither
    does this.
  - The idle cycle (lines 90, 95, 120): while nobody is at the pointer the frame
    is `(quot (mod frame 180) 60)`, sixty frames each of normal, hover and
    pressed, and the hint reads \"cycling the three frames until you hover it\".
  - The text (lines 109-123): `clicks: N`, the frame's name, and
    \"one texture, three frames, sliced by v\".
  - The preview (lines 126-134): the whole sheet drawn at the top right with a
    RED outline around the frame in use.

  Deviations. The mouse becomes touch. A finger down inside the button shows the
  pressed frame. A phone has no pointer to hover with, so the hover frame shows
  while a finger that PRESSED the button has slid off it and is still down, and
  nowhere else. The original's idle cycle is kept and ports exactly: its `live?`
  is \"the pointer is over the button or the mouse is down\", and on a phone
  the pointer is never over anything, so `live?` is just \"a finger is down\".
  While none is, the three frames cycle on the frame count, from the scene's
  first frame; a finger landing stops the cycle that frame and a release starts
  it again where the count has got to. The hint says \"touch\" where the
  original says \"hover\". The release's own position is not trusted, because
  the host hands back the last hardware value, so the scene keeps the position
  of the last frame the finger was down and tests that. The button is half the
  shorter side wide, the preview a quarter, and the layout keeps both below
  Back.

  Entry cost. The first open after launch pauses for about 0.2 s on the phone
  (the largest single frame, measured), while the texture's pixels are computed
  and uploaded. Opening it again takes about one frame, because the filled
  texture buffer is kept.

  The state holds `:clicks`, `:frame`, `:tick` (frames since the scene began),
  `:idle?` (no finger down this frame), `:at` (the last position a finger was
  down, or nil), `:grab` (whether this touch began on the button) and
  `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
