  "Tetris, dragged and tapped. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `tetris` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `tetris`).

  The original moves with LEFT and RIGHT, rotates on UP, soft-drops on DOWN,
  hard-drops on SPACE and restarts on ENTER. Here a horizontal DRAG moves the
  piece, a `:tap` from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` rotates it, a downward `:swipe` hard
  drops it and a `:tap` restarts after game over, unless it lands in the Back
  region, which belongs to the host. The soft drop is dropped: a held finger is
  already steering, and a second gesture for gravity would fight it.

  The drag keeps its own anchor, because the gesture layer only reports a swipe
  at the release. On `:press` the scene records the finger's x and the piece's
  column. While the finger is down the target column is that column plus the
  finger's travel in cells, rounded, and the piece steps toward it one column at
  a time through `valid?`, so it stops at a wall or a block rather than jumping
  over one. Only the raw `:pointer` on `:press` and `:down` is read, never the
  `:release`, whose position is the last hardware value. A press that starts in
  the Back region starts no drag.

  The same finger then reports a horizontal `:swipe` on release, which is
  IGNORED, since the drag already moved the piece. A swipe up does nothing. A
  tap, whose travel is at most `gesture/slop`, cannot have moved the piece,
  because the slop is under half a cell on the phone in either orientation
  (21.7 px against a 50 px half cell tall and a 27 px one wide, and a test pins
  that), so the rounded travel is zero. A swipe down that drifts a cell or more
  sideways does move the piece first, which follows the finger and is accepted.
  If a piece locks while the finger is still down, the drag re-anchors on the
  next piece from the finger's current x, so the new piece does not jump.

  The rules are the original's: ten columns by twenty rows, the seven pieces and
  their rotations, `valid?`, locking, line clears, the 0, 40, 100, 300, 1200
  score table, ten lines per level and the gravity interval of `max 6 (48 - 4 *
  level)` frames. A blocked rotation is refused and a piece that cannot spawn
  ends the game. The original picks each piece with `get-random-value 0 6`,
  which is uniform, so here the project's LCG supplies its HIGH bits (its low
  bit alternates on every step) and the piece is that value mod 7.

  Gravity is a frame count, as in the original, so the game falls faster on a
  120 Hz display than on a 60 Hz one. The Delta Time scene shows why that
  matters. It is kept here because the point of the port is the original, and a
  frame count needs no pixel scaling.

  The well is the largest 10 by 20 grid that fits below the Back button. On a
  tall phone the score, lines, level and next piece sit in a band above the
  well, and on a wide one they sit to its right.

  The original keeps drawing the falling piece over the stack once the game is
  over. The port hides it, because the piece that could not spawn sits on top of
  locked cells and would be drawn on them, which reads as a glitch more than as
  the cause of the loss.

  The state remembers its `:screen` and a rotation starts a new game, as
  Breakout's does. Cells hold a piece keyword and colours are `[r g b a]`
  vectors, so the namespace stays pure. The draw method packs them."
