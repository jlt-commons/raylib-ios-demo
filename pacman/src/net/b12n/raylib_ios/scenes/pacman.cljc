  "Pac-Man, steered by swipes. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `pacman` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `pacman`), which came
  from Michiel Borkent's example in babashka/ffi (MIT).

  The original steers with the arrow keys or WASD and restarts with ENTER. Here
  a `:swipe` from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` sets the desired direction, and a `:tap`
  restarts after game over unless it lands in the Back region, which is the
  host's. A swipe is queued, not applied: Pac-Man takes it at the next tile
  centre where that way is open, which is what a held key does in the original,
  so a swipe into a wall waits until the way opens and a swipe a little early
  still corners. A swipe never turns him between centres, because deciding there
  is what lets an entity drift into a wall.

  The rules are the original's: a maze of 19 by 21 tiles with side tunnels, dots
  worth 10 and four power pellets worth 50, four ghosts with their own
  personalities (see `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.pacman.ghosts`) that alternate between
  scatter and chase on a timer and turn blue for seven seconds after a power
  pellet, the 200, 400, 800 and 1600 combo for eating them, three lives, a
  level cleared when the last dot goes (then the next level, with score and lives
  kept), and game over when the last life does. The original's two constants
  `SCATTER-SECONDS` (20) and `CHASE-SECONDS` (7) are named the wrong way round.
  What it does is scatter for 7 s, then chase for 20 s, and that is what
  `scatter-seconds` and `chase-seconds` hold.

  The original calls `get-frame-time` once per frame, so `advance` reads
  `:delta-seconds`, clamped to 0 below and 0.05 above, which is the original's
  cap against a stalled frame stepping an entity through a wall. Everything is
  in tile units and seconds, so nothing scales with the screen except the
  layout: the maze is drawn with the largest square tile that fits the safe
  region below Back and a HUD row, so a rotation re-lays it out and keeps the
  game. The one fix to the original is the level clear. It re-arms the two
  second `LEVEL CLEARED` timer on every frame while the dots are gone, so the
  next level never begins. Here it is set once, and the board freezes while
  `LEVEL CLEARED` shows, so no ghost can take a life from a cleared board.

  The original draws Pac-Man with `sector!`, which isn't bound here. His mouth
  is a fan of triangles (`pac-fan`) the draw method gives to `rl/draw-triangle`.
  The ghosts' three feet are spaced evenly inside the body (`foot-xs`). The
  original's third foot sticks out past the body's right edge and shows as a
  loose dot.
  The original's `rand-nth` for a frightened ghost is the project's LCG, taking
  its high bits. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors. The draw method packs them
  with `rl/rgba`."
