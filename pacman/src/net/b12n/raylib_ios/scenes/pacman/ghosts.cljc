  "The four ghosts of `pacman`: where they start, what each one aims at, how one
  picks a direction at a tile centre, and how one moves. Everything is in tile
  units (see `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.pacman.maze`).

  The personalities are the original's. Blinky heads for Pac-Man's tile. Pinky
  aims four tiles ahead of him, Inky reflects Blinky's tile through the point
  two tiles ahead of him, and Clyde chases until he is within eight tiles, then
  breaks for his corner. A ghost never reverses, which is what makes it commit
  to a route. A frightened ghost picks among the open ways at random, here from
  a `:pick` integer the caller draws from the project's LCG."
