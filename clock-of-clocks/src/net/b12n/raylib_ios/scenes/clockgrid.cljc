(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.clockgrid
  "The time spelled out by a grid of little clock faces. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `clock-of-clocks` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `clock_of_clocks`), itself a port of raylib's `shapes_clock_of_clocks.c`.

  Six digits, each a 4x6 grid of small clocks whose 48 hands swing into position
  to draw the digit. Every digit is a lookup of 24 hand-angle pairs, and each
  second the hands sweep from wherever they are to wherever the next digit wants
  them.

  Laid out three rows of two rather than the original's single row of six.
  Twenty-four faces across a portrait phone leaves each one about 50 pixels
  wide, which is too small to read as a clock. Stacked as hours, minutes and
  seconds it is eight across, and the same picture through ninety degrees. Same
  decision as the epicycles port, for the same reason.

  Angles follow raylib's screen convention: 0 points right and positive turns
  clockwise, because y grows downward."
