  ;; Three drafts, and the middle one is the interesting failure.
  ;;
  ;; The bezels were draw-ring at 20 segments: 120 vertices each, 17000 FFI
  ;; calls a frame for 144 of them, 6 fps. draw-circle-lines is ONE call and
  ;; draws the same circle. rlgl is the right tool when raylib has no call for
  ;; the shape, and the wrong one when it does. That alone took it to 50.
  ;;
  ;; Then the 288 hands were collected into a vector and handed to a single
  ;; batched rlgl call, to save the 864 calls that 288 separate begin/colour/end
  ;; triples cost. It measured 47. The batch saved the calls and paid for them
  ;; in 288 vector allocations, which is this project's oldest lesson arriving
  ;; again: the allocation costs more than the call.
  ;;
  ;; So the batch stays and the vector goes. One begin, one colour, one end, and
  ;; the vertices emitted straight from the loop with nothing allocated between.
