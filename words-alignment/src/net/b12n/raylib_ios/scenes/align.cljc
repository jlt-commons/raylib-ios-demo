  "One word placed left, centre and right inside a box, using the width raylib
  measures for it. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `words-alignment` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `words_alignment`).

  `MeasureText` is one of the few raylib calls this project can bind directly:
  it takes a string and an int and returns an int, with no by-value struct
  anywhere, so there is nothing to work around. That makes this the rare scene
  where the port is the C example rather than a reconstruction of it.

  Alignment itself is arithmetic on that measurement, and it lives here rather
  than in the draw method so it can be tested against a measuring function that
  is not raylib. The tests use a stub of fixed-width glyphs, which is enough to
  pin the three offsets and the degenerate cases: a word wider than its box, and
  a word of nothing at all."
