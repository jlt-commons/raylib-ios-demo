(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.clipbox
  "A grid drawn across the whole screen, with only the part inside a moving box
  visible. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `scissor-test` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `scissor_test`).

  The scene exists to show the scissor, and porting it exposed something about
  how this project already uses one. Every scene here is drawn inside a scissor
  set to the phone's safe region, so the notch and home indicator stay clear. A
  scene that then sets a scissor of its own does not nest inside that: rlgl's
  scissor is a single rectangle and `BeginScissorMode` replaces it outright. So
  a scene clipping to its own box would be free to paint over the status bar the
  host had just moved it clear of.

  The fix is to intersect rather than replace, which is why `clip-rect` takes the
  safe region as well as the wanted box. Two rectangles that do not overlap
  intersect to nothing, and this returns nil for that rather than a negative
  width, because raylib reads a negative width as a very large unsigned one and
  clips nothing at all."
