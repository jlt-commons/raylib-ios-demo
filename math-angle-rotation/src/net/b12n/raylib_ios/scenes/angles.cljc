  "A ring of fixed spokes and one that turns, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `math-angle-rotation` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `math_angle_rotation`).

  The smallest scene here, and the one that says the most about how everything
  else is drawn. Every circular thing in this gallery is the same two lines:

      x = cx + r * cos(a)
      y = cy + r * sin(a)

  The kaleidoscope, the epicycles, the colour wheel, the pie chart and the
  tesseract's projection are all that, with different values of `a`. This one
  draws it plainly so the rest are easier to read.

  Screen y grows downward, so a positive angle sweeps clockwise here where the
  same maths on graph paper goes anticlockwise. Nothing compensates for it: the
  spokes are evenly spaced either way, and pretending otherwise would mean a
  minus sign that has to be explained everywhere it appears."
