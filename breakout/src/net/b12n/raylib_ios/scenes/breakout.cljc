  "Breakout: slide the paddle under the ball and clear every brick. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `breakout` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `breakout`).

  The original's paddle follows the mouse and SPACE starts a new game. Here the
  paddle's centre follows the finger's x while one is on the glass (`:press` or
  `:down`), clamped so the paddle stays inside the screen, and holds its place
  otherwise. Nothing moves on `:release`, whose position is the last hardware
  value and on a device is not the touch that just ended. After game over or a
  win, a `:press` anywhere outside the top-left Back region starts a new game.

  The rules are the original's: the walls and ceiling bounce, a brick is removed
  and `vy` flipped on contact, the paddle bounces the ball up and adds sideways
  speed by `0.08` of how far from the paddle's centre it landed, and there are
  three lives. The 800x450 layout is scaled to the safe region: horizontal speed
  by `w / 800`, vertical speed by `h / 450`, the brick band to start at 15% of
  the height.

  This is frame-locked, like the original: `advance` moves the ball a fixed
  distance per call, so the game runs faster on a 120 Hz display than on a 60 Hz
  one. The Delta Time scene shows why that matters and what the alternative
  looks like. It is kept here because the point of the port is the original.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure. The draw method
  packs them with `rl/rgba`.")
