(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.spirograph
  "A hypotrochoid, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `spirograph` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `spirograph`) example.

  A pen at offset d on a wheel of radius r rolling inside a ring of radius R
  traces a roulette curve; after enough points it resets with fresh random
  r and d.

  Two things changed on the way over, and both are the port pattern for the
  rest of that collection.

  The original owns its loop, calling window!, looping to a deadline, and
  closing. Here the host owns the loop and this is a reducer over frames,
  which is the scene contract in net.b12n.raylib-ios.gallery.core: init, update, draw and
  dispose, each taking and returning state, with no raylib call anywhere in
  this file.

  And the original draws at a fixed 800x450 with the ring hard-coded at
  radius 170 about (400, 225). A phone is 1206x2622, so the geometry derives
  from the live screen the way net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.flappy-bird's `dimensions` does.

  Randomness is a seeded LCG rather than raylib's GetRandomValue, for the
  same reason flappy-bird carries one: it keeps the namespace pure, so the
  curve is reproducible from a seed and the whole thing is testable on a
  build host with no raylib, no SDL and no device.")

(def default-seed 20260903)

;; How many points before the figure resets with new parameters. The original
;; used 1600 at 800x450, and a phone has more room, but this is a frame-rate
;; number rather than an aesthetic one: every point is a line drawn every
;; frame. Measured on an iPhone 17 Pro, 1024 points holds 55 fps, 1344 gives
;; 40 and 1616 gives 35. See docs/guide/performance-on-a-phone.md.
