  "A helix wound around a torus, swept into a tube. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `helitorus` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `helitorus`), which is Michiel Borkent's `examples/helitorus.clj` in
  babashka/ffi (MIT licence); raylib-jlt's port is zlib-licensed work on top of
  it. This is an altered version of both.

  The surface is generated rather than modelled: walk the spine of a helix that
  itself follows a torus, build a local frame (tangent, normal, binormal) at
  each point, sweep a circle around that frame, and you have a tube.
  Projection, lighting and hidden-surface removal are done here rather than by
  raylib. `compute!` writes into primitive arrays that the draw side owns
  (`make-buffers`, allocated once for `max-nu` rings), so a frame of about ten
  thousand vertices allocates nothing. The ring `order` array survives the
  frame: consecutive frames differ by a small rotation, so it starts nearly
  sorted and the insertion sort over it is close to linear. The scene
  decides visibility itself, by the sign of a 2D cross product in screen space,
  and `emit-ring!` sends each kept quad in the winding rlgl keeps. Culling is
  left on: rlgl only queues vertices and draws them at a later flush, so
  switching culling off around the draw calls would not be in force when they
  are drawn, and a quad sent in the other winding would vanish.

  The original's constants are kept: 12 points round the tube, up to 900 along
  the spine, major radius 1.0, minor 0.30, tube radius 0.11, camera distance
  4.6, focal length 3.2, windings 3 to 24, detail 60 to 900, rot-x within 1.45
  radians and zoom 110 to 520. The original's 1000 by 560 window becomes the
  field: the centre of the figure is the field's centre and the zoom, which the
  state keeps in the original's units, is multiplied by `:scale`, the smaller
  of the field's width over 1000 and its height over 560.

  The original starts at 260 rings. This starts at 64 (`start-nu`), chosen from
  a measurement: at 260 the phone ran 19 fps, with compute 29.5 ms and draw 19.5
  ms, because jolt's interpreter is far slower than native on arithmetic. Both
  halves scale with the ring count. Measured at 64 on the phone (release build,
  iPhone 17 Pro, 2026-10-02): compute 7.7 ms and draw 5.0 ms at 59 to 60 fps. The
  limits are the original's 60 to 900, so \"detail +\" still reaches 260.

  Controls here:
  - A one-finger drag in the field turns the figure, in place of the mouse
    drag. Each frame the finger moves, the figure turns by the original's 0.008
    radians a pixel and remembers the motion as a spin (0.35 times the pixels
    of that frame). Both are divided by `:scale`, so the figure turns by the
    same angle for the same fraction of its own size on any screen. The press
    frame only anchors the drag. Released, the spin decays to the original's
    slow idle turn, by the original's `0.94` every 16 ms. The release position
    is never read.
  - A two-finger pinch zooms, in place of the wheel, by the change of finger
    distance (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/pinch-step`'s ratio), held to the original's
    limits. The midpoint and the twist are ignored. Three field fingers do
    nothing, and a lifted finger ends the pinch with no jump. A finger on a
    button is no part of a drag or a pinch, and neither is one under Back.
  - Four buttons below the field replace the arrow keys, read from the input's
    `:touch-points` so a button and the field work at once. \"windings -\" and
    \"windings +\" (LEFT and RIGHT) change the windings by one on a press, and
    \"detail -\" and \"detail +\" (UP and DOWN) change the detail by 4 every
    frame they are held, as the original does with `key-down?`.
  - The original's help line is dropped, since the buttons name themselves, and
    a hint line names the two gestures. The HUD is two lines: the first is the
    original's fps, compute and draw milliseconds (`hud-line`), the second its
    windings and detail (`status-line`). The original's thousand vertices a
    second figure is dropped, and neither line uses `format`.

  The animation runs on `:delta-seconds`, as the original does on
  `get-frame-time`. The surface's colours are the three `palette-` arrays, and
  the other colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."

  hint, each `{:s :x :y :size}`, at one size cut back from `geometry`'s when the
  widest would cover more than 0.92 of the width. The HUD and status lines hold
  the widest text they can print, which is what is measured, so a draw replaces
  them with `hud-line` and `status-line`. Each of `:buttons` gains `:label`,
  `:label-size`, `:label-x` and `:label-y`, the size cut back until the widest
  label fits inside a button. `measure` is `(fn [s size] -> px)`."
