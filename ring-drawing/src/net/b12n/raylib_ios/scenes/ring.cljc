(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.ring
  "A filled annulus whose sweep and inner radius breathe, with a stroked
  outline. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `ring-drawing` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `ring_drawing`), itself raylib's
  `shapes_ring_drawing` minus its raygui sliders.

  This is the scene that would have caught the winding bug on day one. Its whole
  subject is `draw-ring`, so an annulus that renders nothing is not a subtle
  regression here, it is a blank screen. The analog clock hid the same fault for
  a day because its bezel is one thin ring among sixty tick marks, and a missing
  ring there looks like a design choice.

  The outline is drawn as arcs of short thick lines rather than as a second,
  slightly larger ring. Two rings would z-fight along their shared edge, and the
  lines also give the radial end caps that close the shape."
