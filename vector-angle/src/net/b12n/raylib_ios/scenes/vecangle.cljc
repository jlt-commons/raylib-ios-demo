(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.vecangle
  "Two vectors from one origin, with the signed angle between them filled as an
  arc and read out in degrees. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `vector-angle` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `vector_angle`), itself
  raylib's `shapes_vector_angle`.

  The angle is signed, and that is the whole subject. An unsigned angle is a
  distance and tells you nothing about which way to turn; a signed one is a
  rotation. The readout swings through zero and past 180 into negative, and the
  filled arc follows it, so the sign is visible rather than asserted.

  Screen space runs clockwise from up, because y grows downward, so the bearing
  of a vector is `atan2(x, -y)` rather than the `atan2(y, x)` of a maths
  textbook. Getting that backwards produces angles that look plausible and turn
  the wrong way, which is the kind of bug a still screenshot cannot show."
