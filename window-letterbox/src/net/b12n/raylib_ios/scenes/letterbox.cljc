  "A fixed 480 by 360 picture scaled into a window of any shape, with black bars
  where it does not fill. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `window-letterbox` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `window-letterbox`), a raylib
  example of its own (zlib licence).

  The original draws a 480 by 360 picture into a render texture and blits it
  into the window at the largest scale that fits, centred. `fit` is its `fit`:
  the scale is the smaller of window width over 480 and window height over 360
  (the docstring there says \"multiple\", but it is not rounded), with the
  leftover split into an offset each side, and the blit is at the offset cut to
  whole pixels, `(int (* 480 s))` by `(int (* 360 s))`. The mouse is mapped back
  through the same transform, `(int (/ (- mouse offset) s))`, truncating toward
  zero, and the crosshair is drawn only when that lands on the picture,
  `0 <= mx <= 480` and `0 <= my <= 360`. The picture is a clear colour of (24,
  28, 38), two rows of 12 alternating blue blocks of 40 by 12 along the top and
  bottom, a GOLD circle of radius 26 swinging on `240 + 90 sin t` at y 180, two
  lines of text (18 and 13 points) and the RED crosshair of 10 either way. A
  strip across the window's bottom edge reads the window size, the scale and the
  bars, and a second text says whether R made the window resizable.

  Here the window is a virtual window inside the field. Its top-left corner is
  fixed and a square handle in its bottom-right corner resizes it, clamped
  between `:min-win` and `:max-win` of `geometry`. It starts at the original's
  800 by 450 shape, at 80 percent of what the field allows, so the 4:3 picture
  has bars at the sides from the first frame, as the original's own window was
  chosen to give. The render texture becomes a scissor on the blit rectangle and a
  push, translate and scale in the draw method (to the blit's corner, then blit
  over 480 or 360), which clips to the texture's edges.

  Controls here, in place of the mouse:
  - Dragging the handle resizes the window by the finger's travel, from wherever
    on the handle it was grabbed. A touch that starts anywhere else, under Back
    excepted, is the mouse: the crosshair follows the finger while it is down
    and stays where it was after it lifts, like a mouse left alone, though it is
    not drawn when that point is outside the picture. It starts at the middle of
    the window. A finger that starts elsewhere and slides onto the handle does
    not resize.

  Dropped, and disclosed in the catalog row:
  - R, which toggles the window's resizable flag, and the two window-state
    calls behind it. A phone has no such flag, and the virtual window is always
    resizable, so the second text is the original's resizable branch,
    \"resizable - drag a corner\", in GREEN.
  - The readout strip on the window's bottom edge. A window as narrow as the
    smallest one here cannot hold the original's line, so the readout is two lines
    above the field in the text size the screen allows: the same words, the
    window, the scale and the bars, then the resizable text.
  - `format`, which is `f2` here.

  `:t` is the sum of `:delta-seconds`, the original's `get-time`, unclamped. The
  state holds numbers, keywords and vectors of numbers only: `:win`, `:t`,
  `:mouse` in field pixels, `:grab` and its offset and `:screen`.
  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
