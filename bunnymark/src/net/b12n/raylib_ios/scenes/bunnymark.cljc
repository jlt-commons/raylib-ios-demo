  "Bunnymark, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `bunnymark` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `bunnymark`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/bunnymark.clj, zlib licence), the traditional sprite-count
  benchmark: hold to spawn bunnies that bounce off the edges, and watch the frame
  rate fall as they pile up.

  Each bunny is a tinted square of the original sprite's size. The original draws
  a 32 by 32 texture with `texture!`, whose pixels it builds by hand (lines
  22-37); there is no texture here, so the rabbit's silhouette is dropped and
  only its tint is kept. A count and the sprite's size are what the benchmark
  measures.

  What is the original's:
  - `spawn` (lines 39-52): x and y at the touch point, vx and vy
    `GetRandomValue(-250, 250) / 60`, and each colour channel
    `GetRandomValue(90, 255)`, drawn in the order x y vx vy r g b. The opening
    spawn is `:scattered`, with x in 0 to 768 (`W - SPRITE`) and y in 0 to
    `H - SPRITE`. `GetRandomValue` is the project's LCG seeded with 20261002,
    taking its high bits, so every run opens the same.
  - `step` (lines 54-61): move by the velocity, then flip the velocity of an axis
    whose sprite is outside the window. The position is not clamped, so a bunny
    that lands outside stays there until its next step brings it back.
  - The main loop (lines 63-100): 200 bunnies to start, BATCH of 60 added per
    frame while the button is held and the count is under MAX-BUNNIES of 40000
    (so the count can end up to 59 past it: 200 + 60 k first reaches 40000 at
    40040), then every bunny is stepped, including the new ones.
  - The count text and the fps readout (lines 108-111). The fps is the host's own
    `GetFPS`, read every frame by the gallery as `starfield` and `deltatime` do.

  Controls: holding a finger anywhere outside Back and outside the clear button
  spawns at that point, in place of the left mouse button. Only the field takes
  a spawn (the original cannot spawn outside its window): a finger above it or
  off its edge adds nothing. A finger belongs to the control it began on, so
  one that began on the clear button or in Back never spawns wherever it slides,
  and one that began in the field stops spawning while it is over the button. A tap on the \"clear\"
  button empties the field, in place of SPACE. The tap is by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture`, so
  it is where the finger started. The tap arrives on the release frame, when no
  finger is down, so a clear and a spawn never share a frame.

  Units. The original's window is 800 by 450. Here the bunnies move in its units
  (the physics above is the original's, unchanged), but the window is 800 wide
  and `(h - top) / u` tall, where `u` is the safe region's width over 800 and
  `top` is the bottom of Back, so a bunny is square on a phone and a portrait
  field is taller than 450 units. A tall field takes longer to cross, because
  the velocities are the original's per frame. The bar with the text sits over
  the top of the field, as the original's header does, and a bunny goes under it.

  The state holds numbers only, in mutable arrays: `:xs :ys :vxs :vys` (doubles)
  and `:rs :gs :bs` (ints) with `:n` bunnies live, a capacity of `capacity`, the
  LCG `:seed`, the `:gesture` and the `:screen` it was laid out for. When the
  phone turns, the field's height changes, so `advance` clamps every bunny's y
  into the new field in place (the original's window never changes, so it has
  no such rule). `advance` updates the arrays IN PLACE and
  returns the state with a new `:n`, so a hot loop over forty thousand bunnies
  allocates nothing per bunny; a state is not a value to keep across `advance`.
  `bunny` and `set-bunny!` are the allocating accessors for tests."
