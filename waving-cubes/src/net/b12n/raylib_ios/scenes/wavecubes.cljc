(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.wavecubes
  "A grid of columns whose heights ripple like water, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `waving-cubes` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `waving_cubes`) (zlib licence), with a smaller grid.

  The original draws 14 by 14 columns, 196, at every `(ix, iz)` with spacing
  1.5, centred on the origin: `x = ix * 1.5 - half` and the same for z, where
  half is `0.5 * (n - 1) * 1.5`. Its time is `t = 0.06 * frame`. The height is
  `0.6 + 2.4 * (1 + sin(0.6 ix + 0.6 iz + t))`, so 0.6 to 5.4, and the column
  is a box of size `[1, height, 1]` centred at half that height. The colour is
  three sines, `(int (+ 128 (* 127 (sin ...))))` of `0.35 ix + t`,
  `0.35 iz + t + 2` and `0.35 (ix + iz) + t + 4`, with alpha 255. The camera
  orbits at `a = 0.012 * frame` at `(1.3 span cos a, 0.9 span, 1.3 span sin a)`
  looking at `(0, 1.5, 0)` through a 45 degree perspective camera, where span
  is `1.5 n`, 21 in the original. The wave, the colours, the spacing, the
  heights and the camera's proportions are the original's, and so is the
  shading (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s shades are raylib-jlt's `cube!`). Nothing reads
  a frame time, like the original: both the wave and the orbit advance by frame.

  The grid here is 9 by 9, 81 columns, where the original has 14 by 14, 196.
  The first version of this port, with all 196 columns through
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube` and `finish`, ran at 15 fps on an iPhone 17 Pro, 67 ms a
  frame. This version paints by axis order instead of `finish` and draws 81.
  Span follows the grid, so the camera comes in to frame 9 columns as the
  original framed 14, and the wave keeps its ripple per column but shows fewer
  ripples across.

  There is no input and so no control to map. The original's on-screen fps
  counter (`fps!`) is dropped, as earlier scenes drop theirs; the caption is
  the original's text with this grid's count. It sits below Back, with the 3D
  view in the field under it, full width to the bottom, clipped to it by the
  draw method. The original's fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide
  as 800x450, and in a narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it so
  the original's horizontal view still fits.

  A frame has no grid and no line, and 468 to 486 triangles: from the camera a
  column shows its top and two sides. `scene-list` paints the columns far to
  near by ordering each axis of the grid farthest first (`axis-order`), which a
  grid of boxes needs no sort of triangles for; see `scene-list`. With no
  depth buffer a tall column near the camera over a short one behind it can
  leave a little residue where their edges meet.

  The state holds only `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
