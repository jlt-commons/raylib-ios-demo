(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.resize
  "A rectangle you resize by dragging its corner handle. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `rectangle-scaling` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rectangle_scaling`).

  The original tracks a mouse, which is always somewhere even when no button is
  down, so it can highlight the handle on hover and only resize on a press. A
  finger has no hover: it is either on the glass or it does not exist. So the
  handle highlights while it is being held rather than while it is being pointed
  at, and the scene reads the same without pretending to a state the hardware
  does not have.

  The grab is sticky. Once a finger has taken the handle it keeps it until the
  finger lifts, even if it wanders outside the handle's own box. Testing
  containment every frame instead is the obvious version and it drops the
  rectangle the moment you drag faster than the corner follows."
