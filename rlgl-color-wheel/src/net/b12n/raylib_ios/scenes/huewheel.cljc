  "A hue wheel built as an rlgl triangle fan, with a colour on every vertex.
  Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `rlgl-color-wheel` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rlgl_color_wheel`), which is raylib's
  `shapes_rlgl_color_wheel` example. It is a different example from
  `colorwheel`, which came from `color_wheel` and draws filled sectors: this one
  hands the GPU a few dozen triangles that share the centre and lets it
  interpolate every shade between the rim hues.

  The original takes its controls from the mouse wheel, the arrow keys and
  SPACE. Here a vertical swipe changes the triangle count, a horizontal drag
  sets the centre brightness and a `:tap` toggles fill and wireframe. UP and
  DOWN resized the wheel in the original. That is dropped: the wheel is sized to
  fit the safe region below Back instead, which a phone cannot do by key.

  The count keeps the original's range, 3 to 128, and starts at its 32. The
  mouse wheel stepped it by one a notch. A swipe is a bigger gesture than a
  notch, so it doubles or halves the count, clamped to that range. That is why
  the count can land on 4 or on 3 rather than only on powers of two.

  The brightness drag keeps its own anchor, because the gesture layer only
  reports a swipe at the release. On `:press` the scene records the finger's x
  and the current brightness, and while the finger is down the brightness is the
  anchored one plus `k` times the distance dragged right, clamped to 0..1. `k` is
  one over the width, so a drag across the safe region spans the whole range. The
  same finger reports a `:swipe :left` or `:right` on release, which is IGNORED:
  the brightness already moved while the finger was down, and applying the
  swipe would count the drag twice. Only `:pointer` on `:press` and `:down` is
  read, never the `:release` position.

  A vertical swipe and a horizontal drag come from one finger, so a vertical
  swipe that drifts sideways nudges the brightness. There is no rule that waits
  for the horizontal travel to dominate, because any such gate has to pick a
  value to hold when it closes, and that makes the brightness jump when the
  finger crosses the diagonal. Without it the change is at most `k` times the
  vertical travel, about 8 % of the range for a swipe that just clears the
  threshold at 45 degrees, and a test pins that bound.

  Every wedge is the centre and two rim points, wound by `wound` so the cross
  is negative and survives raylib's back-face culling, as in `rlgltriangle`. A
  culled wedge would leave a gap in the wheel. The wireframe is `draw-line-ex`
  segments: each rim edge and each spoke, in the rim vertex's hue.

  A swipe that starts in `gesture/back-region` and a tap there belong to the
  host and do nothing, and a drag that starts there sets no brightness. Text is
  laid out in `dimensions` below Back, with widths estimated at 0.6 of the size
  per character."
