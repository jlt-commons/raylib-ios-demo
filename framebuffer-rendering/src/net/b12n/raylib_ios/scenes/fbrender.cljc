  "Framebuffer Rendering, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `framebuffer-rendering` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `framebuffer_rendering`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/framebuffer_rendering.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_framebuffer_rendering`. The raylib C example it follows is zlib
  licensed, and this is an altered version of that too.

  The same scene twice, each rendered into its own render target before
  anything reaches the screen. The observer view watches the cube AND the other
  camera, drawn as its view frustum. The subject view is what that camera
  actually sees. The green square in the middle of the subject view is copied
  out again as an inset in its corner, which is the same texture sampled through
  a narrower source rectangle, not a third pass. The projection is in software,
  by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`, drawn into each target as a 2D draw list.

  Mirrored from framebuffer_rendering.clj:
  - The constants (lines 31-36): `crop` 128, `fovy` 45.0 and `frustum-depth`
    3.0, kept as they are. The original's `HALF-W` 400 and its height 450 are
    `original-half-w` and `original-half-h`; here each half is as large as its
    viewport (see Deviations).
  - The world (lines 102-114): a gold cube of side 2 at the origin, PINK wires
    on it, a grid of 10 spaced 1, drawn flat as `DrawCube` colours it.
  - The cameras (lines 61-68, 133-134): a subject camera orbiting the origin at
    radius 5, height 2, `0.012` radians a frame, and an observer at radius 14,
    height 10, `0.004`, both looking at the origin with fovy 45.
  - The frustum (lines 70-100): the subject camera's own position, target and
    field of view give the four far-plane corners at `frustum-depth`, and the
    prism is four edges from the apex to them and the four edges of the far
    rectangle, in GREEN. The aspect is the subject view's own.
  - The observer's pass (lines 151-165): a clear to RAYWHITE, the world and the
    prism, the text \"observer view\" in size 20 BLACK near the bottom and \"both
    cameras orbit on their own\" in size 10 DARKGRAY at the top.
  - The subject's pass (lines 166-180): a clear to RAYWHITE, the world, a GREEN
    outline of `crop` square in the middle, and \"subject view\" in size 20.
  - The screen (lines 181-217): the observer, then the subject, drawn with
    `:v0 1.0 :v1 0.0`; the inset, a `crop` square at 20 in from the subject
    view's corner sampling the middle `crop` of the subject target (still
    flipped), with a GREEN outline; and a DARKGRAY line between the views.

  Deviations. Each half's target is the size of its viewport, not 400 by 450: the
  field below Back is cut in two, stacked in portrait and side by side in
  landscape as 3D Split Screen does, so a half is about the screen's width in
  portrait. The `crop` and the inset's 20 stay in target pixels, so on a large
  half they are small. The text sizes are the original's times the half's scale
  (the smaller of its width over 400 and height over 450), cut back until they
  fit. The frame counter is the original's `frame`, one a frame. The cameras
  are not fitted to the half's aspect (they keep the original's 45), and the
  prism uses the half's aspect. The painter has no depth buffer, so the prism
  is not depth tested against the cube. Each of its 8 segments is instead
  painted under the cube's faces when the segment's midpoint is farther from
  the observer than the cube's centre, and over them otherwise (`prism-layers`).
  That is an approximation, not a depth test: a long edge can cross the cube's
  depth, so such a segment is wholly hidden or wholly drawn, where the
  original would show part of it. The original's `fps!` is dropped.

  The state holds `:frame`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
