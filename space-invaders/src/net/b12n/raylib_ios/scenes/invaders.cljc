(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.invaders
  "Space Invaders on one finger. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `space-invaders` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `space_invaders`).

  The original moves the ship with the left and right arrows and fires on a
  SPACE press. Here the ship's centre follows the finger's x while one is on the
  glass (`:press` or `:down`), clamped to the screen, and holds still otherwise.
  Nothing moves on `:release`, whose position is the last hardware value. Firing
  is automatic while a finger is down. After game over or a win a `:tap` from
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` restarts, unless it lands in the Back region, which belongs
  to the host.

  The rules are the original's. Its fire rule is a 15-frame cooldown on a SPACE
  press, not one bullet at a time, so a player mashing the key gets a shot every
  16 frames and several bullets fly at once. A held finger fires at that same
  cadence. An 8 by 4 formation marches sideways 1.2 px a frame, and on touching
  a wall margin of 6 it reverses and drops 18 px without moving sideways that
  frame. A bullet is a point tested against each alien's rectangle, a hit removes
  the alien and scores 10, and the game is won when none are left and lost when
  the lowest alien's bottom reaches the ship's row.

  The 800x450 layout is scaled into the play area below `gesture/back-region`:
  horizontal measures by `w / 800` and vertical ones by the play area's height
  over 450, so the formation takes as many frames to cross, and as many drops to
  reach the ship, as the original's does. Alien and ship sizes keep their
  aspect and scale by width alone, so on a tall phone the rows are further
  apart than the aliens are tall. The bullet's speed is capped at half an
  alien's height, so the point test cannot skip over one.

  This is frame-locked, like the original: `advance` moves everything a fixed
  distance per call, so the game runs faster on a 120 Hz display than on a 60 Hz
  one. The Delta Time scene shows why that matters. It is kept here because the
  point of the port is the original.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors. The draw method packs them with `rl/rgba`."
