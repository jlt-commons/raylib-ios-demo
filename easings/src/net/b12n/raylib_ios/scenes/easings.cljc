  "All fifteen easing curves at once, each plotted and each driving a dot.

  raylib-jolt-demo (originally raylib-jlt) splits this across several demos:
  `easings` draws the family, `easings-ball` animates one, `easings-rectangles`
  another. A phone screen is tall enough to hold the lot, and seeing them together is the point, because
  a curve on its own tells you very little about how it feels.

  Each cell plots its curve across the cell and runs a dot along it on a shared
  clock, so every dot starts and finishes together and the differences between
  them are exactly the curves. The pairs are deliberate: `quad-in` beside
  `quad-out`, `elastic-in` beside `elastic-out`. An -in curve is its -out
  reflected, and reading them side by side is what makes that obvious.

  Watch `elastic-out` and `back-out` leave their cells. Both overshoot past the
  target and settle back, which is the whole reason they exist, and it is also
  why the plot is drawn with room above and below rather than filling its cell."
