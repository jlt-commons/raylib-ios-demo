(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.rlgltriangle
  "One Gouraud-shaded triangle whose three corners you drag. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `rlgl-triangle` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rlgl_triangle`).

  The colour across the face is the point. rlgl carries a colour per vertex, so
  red, green and blue at the three corners let the GPU interpolate the whole
  gradient.

  Winding matters in filled mode. raylib's default culls back faces, so
  dragging a corner past the other two would flip the triangle away and make it
  vanish. Rather than toggle culling as the C example does, `wound` sorts the
  corners into the winding that survives before drawing, with each colour
  travelling with its corner.

  The mouse version has SPACE for outline and R for reset, and grabs a handle
  whenever the cursor is near and the button is down. Here the two keys are
  buttons along the bottom edge, and the grab is sticky: decided on the `:press`
  and held until the finger lifts, as `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.resize` does, so a fast
  drag cannot outrun the corner and lose it. The `:release` frame is ignored
  because its position is stale on a device."
