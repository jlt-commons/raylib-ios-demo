  "Sprite Animation, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `sprite-animation` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `sprite_animation`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/sprite_animation.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_sprite_animation`: one strip of six frames goes to the GPU once, and
  a source rectangle walks along it. Only the texcoords change.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  Mirrored from sprite_animation.clj:
  - The strip (lines 37-89): 576 by 120 (lines 26-29), six frames of 96 by 120,
    transparent, with a stick walker painted into each by `ImageDrawCircle`.
    `strip-grid` replays the original's calls through `net.b12n.raylib-ios.texel`: `thick-line`
    (lines 37-48) is fifteen circles along a limb, `draw-pose` (lines 50-78) is
    the legs, torso, arms, head and eye of pose `i`. The calls are the original's
    in the original's order, so overdraw resolves the same way, and the circle
    is `texel/draw-circle`, which keeps raylib 6.0's quirk of coming out a texel
    short on the right and bottom.
  - The rate (lines 31-32, 105-112): the speed runs 1 to 15 and starts at 8. A
    counter reaching `(quot 60 speed)` moves to the next frame and resets.
  - The texcoords (lines 113-114): frame `i` samples `i/6` to `(i+1)/6`.
  - The text and boxes (lines 139-176): the strip's note, \"FRAME SPEED:\" with
    the rate, fifteen boxes of which `speed` are filled RED, outlined MAROON, and
    the strip outlined LIME with the current frame boxed RED.

  Deviations. LEFT and RIGHT are two buttons, SLOWER and FASTER, and a press is
  the key's first frame. The layout is stacked and scaled to the screen, not an
  800 by 450 window: the strip is as wide as fits (its height never over a fifth
  of the screen), then the speed line, the boxes and the buttons, with the
  current frame drawn larger at the bottom, at the original's 128 by 160
  proportion. The window-title text is dropped, since the gallery shows the
  title. The hint reads \"Tap SLOWER or FASTER to change the rate\".

  Entry cost. The first open after launch pauses for about 1.0 s on the phone
  (the largest single frame, measured), while the texture's pixels are computed
  and uploaded. Opening it again takes about one frame, because the filled
  texture buffer is kept.

  The state holds `:counter`, `:current`, `:speed` and `:screen`. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors."
