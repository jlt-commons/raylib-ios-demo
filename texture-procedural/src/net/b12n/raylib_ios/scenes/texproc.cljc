  "Procedural Textures, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `texture-procedural` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `texture_procedural`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/texture_procedural.clj, zlib licence), which is
  raylib-jlt's own example rather than a port of a raylib C example. raylib
  6.0's nearest is `textures_image_generation`, which builds gradients, a
  checkerboard and noise with GenImage* on the CPU. Here: four textures
  generated pixel by pixel and uploaded to the GPU, each drawn as one quad.

  Mirrored from texture_procedural.clj:
  - TEX (line 21): each texture is 128 by 128 texels.
  - `checker` (lines 24-28): 16-texel cells, dark (40, 44, 52) where
    `(x / 16) + (y / 16)` is even, else light (230, 232, 238).
  - `gradient` (lines 30-35): red runs with x and green with y, each as
    `255 * v / 128` truncated, blue 140.
  - `noise` (lines 37-40): a grey, one value 0..255 a texel.
  - `rings` (lines 42-48): the distance from (64, 64), `sin (d / 6)`, then
    `v = 127 * (1 + t)` truncated, coloured `(v, 0.4 v truncated, 255 - v)`.
  - The order and names (lines 50-54): checkerboard, gradient, noise, rings.
  - SPACE (lines 71-74) re-uploads the noise texture in place. Here a press is
    the tap, and it bumps `:version`, which `net.b12n.raylib-ios.texture/id!` reads as \"write
    the pixels again\".
  - The text (lines 77-82, 98-103): the heading, the size line, the panel names
    and \"SPACE reseeds the noise\", whose hint now reads \"Tap to reseed the
    noise\".

  Deviations. The noise does not come from raylib's GetRandomValue. It comes
  from the project LCG, copied privately as the sibling scenes do, so the scene
  stays pure and a seed always replays the same picture. The value is the high
  bits, `(quot seed' 65536)` mod 256, one step a texel in row order. A tap
  reseeds with a second LCG step (`reseed`), because stepping the same LCG once
  would only slide the old picture along by one texel. The panels are a 2 by 2
  grid on a portrait screen and a row of four on a landscape one, whichever
  gives the bigger panel, square, with the names under them.

  Entry cost. The first open after launch pauses for about 0.5 s on the phone
  (the largest single frame, measured), while the texture's pixels are computed
  and uploaded. Opening it again takes about 0.14 s, because the noise texture
  is versioned and so is not kept; the other three open again in about one
  frame.

  The state holds `:seed`, `:version` and `:screen`. A press bumps `:version` and
  reseeds once; the frames a finger stays down change nothing. Colours are `[r g
  b a]` vectors."
