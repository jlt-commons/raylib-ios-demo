  "The Lorenz attractor, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `lorenz-attractor` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `lorenz_attractor`).

  Three coupled equations, integrated forward one small step at a time:

      dx/dt = sigma (y - x)
      dy/dt = x (rho - z) - y
      dz/dt = x y - beta z

  The trajectory never repeats and never escapes. It swaps between two lobes at
  intervals no amount of precision will let you predict, which is the whole
  reason the shape is famous.

  Two things the original does that a phone cannot. It uses raylib's 3D camera,
  and this host binds no camera, so the orbit is done by hand: rotate about Y,
  then divide by depth. It also keeps a 4000-point trail, which is four times
  what docs/guide/performance-on-a-phone.md says fits in a frame here.

  Input-free. The original maps rho to the arrow keys; this holds it at 28.0,
  the value that gives the butterfly, and lets the camera do the moving.")

;; The trail is the whole cost: one segment per point, and every point is
;; re-projected every frame because the camera orbits. That is the difference
;; from lsystem, which holds 59 fps at 1488 segments precomputed once.

;; Swept on an iPhone 17 Pro, reading raylib's own GetFPS with the probe seam
;; calling it every frame:

;; Pinned at vsync to 480, slipping at 500, and falling away steeply past 600.
;; 450 sits inside the flat region with room for a phone that has warmed up.
;; At dt 0.006 that is 2.7 time units of trajectory. Measured over ten seconds
;; from the default seed, 499 frames of 600 show a window that straddles both
;; lobes, so the butterfly reads most of the time and warm handles the opening.
;;
;; Readings above 600 are noisy, +/- 30% between sweeps of the same value, so
;; treat the steep end as indicative and the flat end as solid.
