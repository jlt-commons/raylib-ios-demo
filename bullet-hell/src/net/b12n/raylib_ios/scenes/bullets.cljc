(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.bullets
  "A three-armed bullet spiral, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `bullet-hell` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `bullet_hell`).

  An emitter at the centre turns, and three bullets leave it every frame, 120
  degrees apart. Each flies straight from then on. The spiral is not drawn and
  nothing curves: it is what a rotating source of straight lines looks like,
  which is the same reason a rotating garden sprinkler makes one.

  Bullets are dropped once they leave the region, so the count settles at
  whatever fits in flight rather than growing forever. That bound is why this
  costs the same in its tenth minute as its first.

  The settled count is set by `speed`, because a faster bullet spends fewer
  frames on screen. Measured on the JVM at 693, 467, 349, 281 and 233 for
  speeds 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. That number matters more than it looks: on
  device the cost of this scene is `advance` rebuilding one map per bullet
  per frame, not the drawing. Emptying the draw method entirely moved 700
  bullets from 35 to 43 fps, and swapping circles for squares moved it to
  39, so the allocation is the bill and the pixels are the tip."
