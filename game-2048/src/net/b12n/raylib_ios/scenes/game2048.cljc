  "2048, played by swipe. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `game-2048` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `game_2048`).

  The original slides with the arrow keys and restarts on SPACE. Here a
  `:swipe` from `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` slides the board, and a `:tap` restarts it once
  the game is stuck or won, unless the tap lands in the Back region, which is
  the host's.

  The rules are the original's. Slide and merge is one pure function over a row,
  reused for all four directions by reversing and transposing the rows. A move
  counts only if it changes the board (`try-move` compares the new board with the
  old one, not the score), and only then does a tile spawn: a 2, nine times in
  ten, otherwise a 4, in a random empty cell. The game is stuck when no direction
  changes the board. The original has no win check, so reaching 2048 is added
  here as the brief asks: a board holding a 2048 is `:won?` and takes no more
  moves until a tap restarts it. Since play stops at the first 2048, no tile
  above 2048 appears in play, but the text sizing handles any digit count.

  The original draws a 800 by 450 board at fixed pixels. Here the board is a
  centred square, `(* 0.9 (min w play-h))`, where `play-h` is the screen below
  the Back region and above the score line. Nothing in the state depends on the
  screen, so a rotation only re-lays out the board and the game goes on.

  The original spawns with `rl/get-random-value`. Here spawning uses the
  project's LCG, taking the high bits, because its low bit alternates.

  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
