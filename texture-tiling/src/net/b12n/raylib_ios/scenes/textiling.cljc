  "Texture Tiling, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `texture-tiling` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `texture_tiling`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/texture_tiling.clj, zlib licence), which is raylib-jlt's
  own example and not a port of a raylib C example. raylib 6.0's nearest is
  `textures_tiled_drawing`, which tiles with DrawTextureTiled where this lets
  the GPU's REPEAT wrap do it: one small procedural tile covers the screen as a
  single textured quad, by asking for texture coordinates well past 1.0.

  Mirrored from texture_tiling.clj:
  - The tile (lines 22-35): 64 by 64 (line 21), a diagonal weave over a dark
    ground with a dot in the middle. Inside radius 5 of (32, 32) it is GOLD
    (255, 203, 0); else where `(x + y) mod 16` is under 3 it is BLUE
    (0, 121, 241); else where `(x - y) mod 16` is under 3 it is SKYBLUE
    (102, 191, 255); else (20, 24, 34). `tile-spec` packs it with
    `net.b12n.raylib-ios.texel/pack`, whose byte order is raylib-jlt's `rgba`.
  - The state (lines 49-66): tiles start at 6.0, scroll starts at 0 and grows
    0.004 a frame, and the density moves 0.08 a frame while a key is held, held
    to 1.0 to 24.0. UP wins over DOWN when both are held.
  - The quad (lines 68-77): texcoords run from `scroll` to `scroll + tiles` in
    u and `scroll + tiles * (h / w)` in v, so the tiles stay square.
  - The overlay (lines 78-95): a translucent black band under two lines of
    text, a count of `tiles * tiles * (h / w)` tiles from one 64x64 texture and
    the hint.

  Deviations. The picture is the screen, not an 800 by 450 window, so `h / w` is
  the screen's own. UP and DOWN are two buttons under the text, and a finger held
  on one repeats as the key does. The band sits below Back, and its text is
  sized to fit the width. The hint reads \"Hold UP or DOWN to change density\".

  The state holds `:tiles`, `:scroll`, `:held` (`:up`, `:down` or nil) and
  `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
