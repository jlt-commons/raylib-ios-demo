  "Two boxes and their overlap, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `collision-area` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `collision_area`).

  One box slides back and forth. The other follows your finger. Where they
  overlap, the intersection is filled in red, and the intersection is computed
  here rather than by raylib: an axis-aligned overlap is four `max` and `min`
  calls, and asking raylib would mean passing a Rectangle by value across the
  FFI for no gain.

  The original follows the mouse. A phone has no mouse and does have a finger,
  which is a better fit for this example than it was for the desktop: you can
  drag the box around and watch the overlap change, where a mouse only hovers.

  With nothing touching the screen the box drifts on its own, so the scene is
  alive in a gallery nobody is touching. That is a change from upstream, where
  a still mouse means a still box."
