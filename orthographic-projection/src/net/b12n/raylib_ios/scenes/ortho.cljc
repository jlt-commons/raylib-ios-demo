(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.ortho
  "The same 3D scene in perspective and in orthographic projection, ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `orthographic-projection` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `orthographic_projection`), which is raylib's
  `core_3d_camera_mode` family (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (5, 5, 5) at the origin at three cubes of side 1 in a
  row on a grid of 10: red at (-1.5, 0.5, 0), green at (0, 0.5, 0) and blue at
  (1.5, 0.5, 0), shaded face by face as raylib-jlt's `cube!` does it
  (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default). It starts in perspective with fovy 45 and
  SPACE switches to orthographic, where fovy is the view's height, 12.

  Controls here: a tap anywhere outside Back toggles between the two, in place
  of SPACE (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture/track`, so the finger's start decides, never the
  release). A touch that begins under Back toggles nothing. The caption names
  the mode as the original's does, with \"tap\" for \"SPACE\".

  The original's caption sits below Back, with the 3D view in the field under
  it, full width to the bottom. The view is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`'s `[x y w h]`
  viewport on that field. The original's fovys are kept while the field is at
  least as wide as 800x450. In a narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera`
  widens the perspective fovy, or scales the orthographic height, so the
  original's horizontal view still fits. The grid reaches past the field's
  edges, so the draw method clips to the field.

  The state is `:ortho?` and the gesture. The grid depends on the camera and
  layout only, so `grid-list` builds it for one mode and a draw can keep both.
  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
