  "Text wrapped inside a box you resize by dragging its corner handle. Ported
  from raylib-jolt-demo's `rectangle-bounds` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rectangle_bounds`), which is raylib's
  `text_rectangle_bounds` example.

  The mouse and the keyboard become two touch controls. The corner handle is
  dragged in place of the mouse, and a `:tap` on the wrap button toggles word or
  character wrap in place of SPACE. The original also fades the border and
  handle while the mouse hovers or drags. A finger has no hover, so the faded
  colours show while the handle is held, which is the part of that state a
  touch screen can have.

  The grab is sticky, as in `resize`: the handle is taken on the press that
  lands in its grab box and kept until the finger lifts, so dragging faster than
  the corner follows does not drop it. Unlike `resize`, which snaps the corner
  to the finger, this follows the original and moves the box by the finger's
  change since the last frame, so the handle does not jump to where the finger
  landed. The box is clamped between a minimum and the room above the controls.

  Wrapping lives in `layout-text`, which is pure. The original measures with
  MeasureText, which a pure namespace cannot call, so the layout takes a
  `measure` function `(fn [s size] -> px)`. The draw method passes the real one
  and the tests pass an estimate of 0.6 of the size per character. Text that
  would spill past the box height is dropped a line at a time, the same check
  the original (and raylib's DrawTextBoxed) makes, in place of a scissor.

  Everything lives in the safe region below Back. The box starts below it and
  the hint and the wrap button sit under the box, so nothing is under Back or
  off the screen. Sizes scale with the shorter side over 450, the height of the
  original's window. Text is laid out in `dimensions`."
