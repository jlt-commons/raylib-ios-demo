  "Colours set inside the string itself. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `inline-styling` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `inline_styling`).

  A tiny markup changes the style mid-line: `[cRRGGBBAA]` sets the foreground,
  `[bRRGGBBAA]` paints a background behind the text that follows, and `[r]`
  puts both back. A tag touches only its own slot, so a foreground tag leaves
  the background as it was. The tag's alpha is multiplied by the base colour's
  alpha, rounded down, so one fade on the base fades everything the markup set.

  The grammar is positional, as in the original. A tag is `[r]`, or a `c` or `b`
  and exactly eight hex digits in brackets, in either case of hex. Anything else
  is text, including a stray `[`, so a malformed tag prints as it was typed
  instead of vanishing. Capital `C`, `B` and `R` are not tags.

  The original has no input, so this reads none. It rolls a new colour for the
  word CREATIVE every twenty frames and builds that line's markup from it, which
  is why the colour is a hex string in a tag and not a vector. The roll is frame
  locked as the original's is (it counts frames and never asks for a delta
  time), and it takes three channels from the project LCG's high bits where the
  original calls GetRandomValue. The first frame rolls too, as the original's
  frame 0 does, so the starting red is never drawn.

  The original does not wrap. The port scales the original's sizes and positions
  by one factor `u`, the smaller of the width over its 800 pixels and the room
  below Back over its 250 pixels of content, so the lines keep their
  proportions and fit the safe region. Runs are laid out left to right, each starting where the one
  before it ends, and that needs the width of text, which a pure namespace cannot
  ask raylib for. `layout` takes a `measure` function `(fn [s size] -> px)`. The
  draw method passes the real one and the tests pass an estimate of 0.6 of the
  size per character. Text is laid out in `dimensions`."
