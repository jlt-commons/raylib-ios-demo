(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.fpcamera
  "A first-person camera walked round a yard of columns on two thumbs, ported
  from raylib-jolt-demo's `camera-3d-first-person` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera_3d_first_person`) (zlib licence).

  The original builds 40 columns with `GetRandomValue`: x and z in [-20, 20],
  a height in [2, 12], and each of r, g, b in [60, 255] with alpha 255, in the
  order x, z, h, r, g, b. A column is a box of side 2 by its height by 2
  standing on the ground, drawn by `cube!` (so `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default
  shading). It draws a grid of 40 first, on a sky of (140, 190, 230), from an
  eye 2 units up through a 60 degree perspective camera. Here `GetRandomValue`
  is the project's LCG seeded with 20261002, taking its high bits
  (`(mod (quot seed' 65536) range)`), so the yard is the same every run. The
  counts, ranges, colours and camera are the original's. The projection is in
  software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  The original does not call `UpdateCamera`, and neither does this. It keeps
  a yaw and a pitch and hands raylib a camera whose target is the eye plus the
  look direction (camera_3d_first_person.clj lines 40-53): forward
  on the ground is `(cos yaw, sin yaw)`, right is `(-sin yaw, cos yaw)`, and
  the target is `(px + cos pitch * cos yaw, 2 + sin pitch, pz + cos pitch * sin
  yaw)`. Those formulas are written out here over a camera map `{:position
  :target :up :fovy :projection}`. Nothing of rcamera.h is mirrored.

  The original's keys and mouse, and what stands in for each:
  - W, A, S and D move 0.25 on the ground a frame (`SPEED`), forward and right.
    A relative thumb-stick that starts in the lower third of the field replaces
    them. The press point is its centre. Further than `gesture/slop` from it,
    the eye moves that way (up the glass is forward) 0.25 an update, the
    direction a unit vector, so one speed everywhere. The original's keys add,
    which makes a diagonal 1.41 times faster, and that is the one deliberate
    difference. Nothing reads a frame time, like the original: the speed is
    per update, and walking does not leave the ground when the view is tipped,
    because forward is the ground vector `(cos yaw, sin yaw)` whatever the pitch.
  - The mouse position delta looks, 0.004 radians a pixel (`SENS`), yaw then
    pitch (lines 40-41, the pitch held to +-1.4 radians, `pitch-limit`). A drag that
    starts in the upper two thirds of the field replaces it, times
    `800 / field width` so that a drag across the glass turns as far as one
    across the original's 800 pixel window.
  - Both work at once, each by its own finger.

  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick` decides whose finger it is. A stick or a look begins only on
  a finger that was not down the frame before, inside its region. It follows
  only that finger, by touch id (by nearness when the host gives none), and
  ends when that finger lifts, so a finger that rests, or that began under
  Back, is never adopted in its place. A rotation of the phone drops both. A
  tap moves nothing.

  Dropped: `fps!`, the on-screen frame counter, as earlier scenes drop it, and
  the mouse itself, which a phone has no cursor for. The original's key text
  \"WASD move - mouse look\" is kept as a caption below Back, its words changed
  to the touch controls, sized in `dimensions` so it fits.

  Faces with a corner behind the near plane are dropped whole, a known limit
  of `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`, so standing against a column makes its faces vanish
  rather than clip. The grid is drawn under every face (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish`
  puts all grid lines first), so where the original's depth buffer would show a
  grid line in front of a column's foot, here the column hides it; the grid
  lies on the ground where the columns stand, so only lines under a column's
  footprint are lost. Overlapping columns are ordered whole, face by face, so
  where two columns cross a face can paint over one a depth buffer would put
  in front. Both are limits of the painter, not chased. The original's 60
  degree fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide as 800x450, and
  widened by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a narrower one.

  The state holds `:px`, `:pz`, `:yaw` and `:pitch` (numbers), the `:camera`
  built from them, the finger tracking (`:look` and `:stick`, each
  with its finger's id), `:n` (the finger count last frame), `:pts` and `:ids`
  (that frame's touch points and ids) and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]`
  vectors."
