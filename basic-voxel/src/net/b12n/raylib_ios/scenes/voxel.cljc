  "A block of voxels you walk round and hollow out, on two thumbs. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `basic-voxel` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `basic_voxel`), which is raylib's `models_basic_voxel` (zlib
  licence). The projection is in software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`.

  Mirrored from basic_voxel.clj:
  - The world (lines 79-84, 137-141): an 8 x 8 x 8 block of unit voxels at the
    integer positions 0..7, 512 of them, drawn BEIGE with BLACK wires (lines
    154-164) over a grid of 10 (line 153), through a 45 degree perspective
    camera.
  - The camera (lines 92-135): a yaw and a pitch, the look direction
    `(cos pitch * cos yaw, sin pitch, cos pitch * sin yaw)` (line 124), forward
    on the ground `(cos yaw, sin yaw)` and right `(-sin yaw, cos yaw)` (lines
    125-126), SPEED 0.15 an update, SENS 0.004 a pixel, the pitch held to +-1.4
    (lines 114-121), the height never changing. Until you steer it orbits the
    block's centre (3.5, 3.5) at radius 22 and height 14, 0.006 radians an
    update, facing back at the centre (lines 35-44, 95, 113-115, 118, 131-135),
    and the first walk, look or tap hands it over for good (lines 110-112, 186).
  - The pick (lines 59-77, 137-141): the crosshair is the ray, whatever sits
    under it is what a click takes, the nearest voxel the ray enters. Here
    `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/screen->ray` casts it through the middle of the field, which
    is where the crosshair (a RED dot of radius 4, lines 166-169) is drawn, and
    `ray-box` tests every voxel and keeps the nearest, as the original's brute
    force does. A voxel the eye is inside is at distance 0, as the original has it.

  Controls. The original's left click removes the voxel under the crosshair and
  nothing else. A tap does that, anywhere in the field: the crosshair picks, the
  tap's position does not. W, A, S and D are a relative thumb-stick that starts
  in the lower third of the field (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick`, as `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.fpcamera`),
  the press point its centre, a unit direction at one speed, up the glass
  forward. The mouse position delta is a drag that starts in the upper two
  thirds, times `800 / field width`. Both work at once, each by its own finger.
  A stick or a look begins only on a fresh press and follows only its own
  finger, so a resting finger never steers. A tap is a press and release that
  moved less than `gesture/slop` and never ends a touch of two fingers, so it
  is neither a walk nor a look. So a tap is ignored while the stick is held:
  stop walking to remove, where the original clicks while holding W. One tap
  action, so a button picks the other one:
  - Added, not in the original: placing. The button in the row under Back, at
    the right, flips what a tap does between \"tap: remove\" (the original's
    only rule, and the start) and \"tap: place\". A place puts a voxel on the
    face of the nearest voxel the ray entered, beside it where the ray came in
    (the `ray-box` normal), and does nothing on a miss, on an occupied cell, or
    on a cell that holds the eye. A finger on the button never starts a stick
    or a look.
  - Dropped: `fps!`, and the original's \"left-click a voxel to remove it\"
    line, which the button replaces. The status line (\"N voxels left\") is
    the caption below Back.

  Only exposed faces draw. A face is exposed when the voxel next to it is empty,
  so a full block has 384. `mesh` finds them once, whenever the world changes,
  and merges the exposed faces of each plane greedily into rectangles
  (`:rects`): a full block is six, and the first frame's two sides are two
  rectangles, four triangles. Every face is the one flat opaque BEIGE, so a
  rectangle fills exactly what its unit faces would, and no paint order can show,
  which is why nothing is sorted and `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/finish` is not called. The
  grid goes under, the fills next and the wires over them. The voxels' own grid
  lines stay: the wires are still drawn from the unit faces' edges, each shared
  edge once, with edges that carry on in a straight line joined into one line
  (the same pixels): 35 lines from two sides and 51 from three, where a line for
  each unit edge was 280 and 408. `scene-list` projects each corner once a frame.
  A face with a corner behind the near plane is dropped whole. A rectangle with
  one is drawn as its unit faces instead (`:rect-faces`), each kept or dropped on
  its own corners, so close to a wall the picture is the unmerged one's.

  The cost follows the exposed faces, which grow as the block is hollowed out,
  since each pit shows its walls, and mostly the wires and the corners they
  project, not the fills. Measured under jolt on the laptop (1206x2334, update,
  build and a stand-in for the draw side's code): 0.20 ms from the start view,
  0.28 ms at the orbit's 45 degree corner where three sides show, and 0.94 ms
  for a block with a third of it eaten away in a scattered pattern. Before the
  merge and with a sort they were 0.38, 0.56 and 1.3. The hollowed block is
  about three times what the rest of the gallery is sized by and has not been
  timed on the phone, where 0.56 measured 32 fps.

  There is no depth buffer, so the wires draw after every fill, and in a pit
  hollowed out of the block an edge of the far wall can show over the rim in
  front of it, where raylib's depth test would hide it. On the convex block the
  first frame draws, the wires are exact. A limit of the painter, not chased.
  The original's 45 degree fovy is kept while the field is as wide as 800x450 and
  widened by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a narrower one.

  The state holds `:world` (a set of `[x y z]` integer voxels), `:mesh`, `:mode`
  (`:remove` or `:place`), the pose (`:px` `:py` `:pz` `:yaw` `:pitch`, with
  `:angle` for the idle orbit and `:steered?`), the `:camera` built from it, the
  finger tracking (`:look` and `:stick` with their ids, `:gesture`, `:n`,
  `:pts`, `:ids`) and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
