  "Colour interpolated across a rectangle. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `gradient` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `gradient`),
  itself raylib's `shapes_rectangle_gradient.c`.

  The original draws one vertical band with `DrawRectangleGradientV`, which the
  docstring there calls a good check that two by-value Colors survive a single
  call. That check does not apply here, because nothing in this project passes a
  Color by value: they go across the FFI packed into a uint.

  So the scene grew into what the technique is actually for. raylib spends three
  entry points on this shape, V, H and Ex, and one rlgl quad with a colour per
  vertex covers all three: a vertical gradient is the four-corner case with the
  top pair equal. The bands below are V, H, a four-corner Ex, and one whose
  corners rotate through the wheel so the interpolation is visible in motion."
