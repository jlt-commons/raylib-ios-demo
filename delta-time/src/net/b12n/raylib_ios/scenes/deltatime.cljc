  "Two boxes cross the screen, one by a fixed step per frame and one by a
  distance scaled by the time since the last frame. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `delta-time` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `delta_time`).

  The two agree only at exactly 60 fps, and a phone does not quite get there.
  Measured on an iPhone 17 Pro, the mean frame is 17.1 ms, about 58.5 fps, so
  the delta-time box gains roughly 9 pixels a second and the pair drift apart
  with nothing else going on. Drop the rate from the nREPL with
  `(net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/on-next-frame! (fn [] (net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/set-target-fps 30)))` and the
  per-frame box falls to half speed while the delta-time box keeps its pace.")

  `dt` is clamped at 0 the way `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.analog/advance` clamps it, so a
  bad frame clock cannot drive a box backwards. Both wrap at `w - box` so the
  whole box stays on screen."
