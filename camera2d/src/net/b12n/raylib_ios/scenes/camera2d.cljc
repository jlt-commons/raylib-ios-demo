  "A 2D camera that follows a player along a skyline. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `camera2d` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera2d`), which is raylib's `core_2d_camera` example (zlib licence).

  The original draws 30 buildings, a ground and a red player box through a
  Camera2D whose target follows the player on x. The arrow keys move the
  player 4 units a frame, the mouse wheel zooms by 0.05 a notch between 0.25
  and 3.0, A and D turn the camera a degree a frame, and R resets zoom and
  rotation. A grey line down the middle and a caption are drawn in screen space
  after the world. The buildings, their sizes and colours, the ground and the
  player are the original's formulas.

  Controls here:
  - A relative thumb-stick on x only replaces the left and right arrows. The
    press point is the centre. Further than `gesture/slop` to its left or right
    the player walks that way at the original's 4 world units a frame, frame
    locked, whatever the zoom. Inside the slop, or with the finger only
    drifting up or down, there is no direction, so a tap never moves it. The
    stick is on the glass, so after a twist the player still walks along the
    world's x, which is now tilted on screen, as the arrows did with A and D.
  - Two fingers replace the wheel and A and D. The distance between them
    scales the zoom and the twist of the line through them turns the camera
    (`camera2d/pinch-step`, so the order of the two points never matters). Both
    are about the field's centre, where the original's camera sits, and the
    zoom is held to 0.25 to 3.0 times the base zoom.
  - A \"reset\" button below Back replaces R and restores zoom 1 and rotation 0.
    The player stays where it is, as in the original.

  A pinch and the stick never share a finger. A second finger landing during a
  drag ends the stick at once, so the player stops, and while two fingers are
  down only the pinch acts, and only while exactly two are
  down (`camera2d/pinch-frame`), so a third finger or a reorder of three moves
  nothing. When one lifts, the finger left starts no new stick
  (a stick begins only at a press), so the player stays put until a fresh touch,
  and the next pair of fingers starts a new pinch from its first frame with no
  jump. A tap that ends a pinch is never read as a press on reset.

  The original's 800x450 view is fitted into the field below the caption by
  one base zoom, the smaller of the two axis scales, and the user's zoom
  multiplies that. The camera's offset is the field's centre. Its target is the
  player on x and 200 on y, as the original has it. The world is clipped to the
  field, and the centre line is drawn over it. The original's caption is
  replaced by one that names these controls. Nothing here reads a frame time,
  like the original. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
