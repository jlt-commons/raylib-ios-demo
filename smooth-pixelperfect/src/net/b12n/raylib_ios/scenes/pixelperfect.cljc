(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.pixelperfect
  "Smooth pixel-perfect camera, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `smooth-pixelperfect` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `smooth_pixelperfect`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/smooth_pixelperfect.clj, itself raylib's
  `core_smooth_pixelperfect`, zlib licence), without its render texture.

  What the original shows. Three rectangles spin in a tiny 160 by 90 world that
  is drawn into a 160 by 90 render texture and blown up to the window, 5 screen
  pixels for each world pixel. The camera sways on a sine and cosine path
  (lines 38-39). The world is drawn with the camera on the INTEGER part of that
  position (`wx`, `wy`, lines 40-41), so everything in the texture sits on whole
  pixels and the upscaled picture is crisp but steps a whole 5 pixels at a time.
  The fractional part, times the ratio (`sx`, `sy`, lines 42-43), is applied
  when the texture is blitted: the blit is drawn under a second camera whose
  target is that remainder, which slides the finished picture by minus the
  remainder on the glass. The step is gone, and the motion is smooth while the
  pixels stay crisp. S turns that second camera off, so the stepping shows, and
  O turns on overscan: the blit grows by one ratio on every side, so the slide
  never uncovers an edge.

  What is the original's here: the 160 by 90 world, the sway (`world`: cx is
  sin t * 50 - 10, cy is cos t * 30, truncated toward zero for the integer part),
  the three rects with their sizes, colours, positions and spins (`rects`: rot,
  minus rot, rot + 45, turning about their top-left corners, where
  `rect-pro!` has no origin), the spin of 60 degrees a second, the remainder
  times the ratio, the two blit rects (overscan: -R, -R, W + 2R, H + 2R of the
  window; off: the picture centred with an 80 by 45 border, which is 640 by 360
  of 800 by 450), the colours, and the four readouts: the screen and world
  resolutions, the Smooth and Overscan state and the fps.

  How the render texture is replaced. There is no texture. The world is drawn
  straight to the screen under `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/with-camera-2d` with:
  - the zoom `R`, the largest whole number of screen pixels for a world pixel
    that fits 160 by 90 into the field (`geometry`). It is the original's RATIO,
    which was 5 because 800 is 5 times 160. The window is the virtual screen at
    that zoom, 160R by 90R, centred in the field and clipped to by a scissor.
  - the camera target on the integer part of the sway, so every rect sits on a
    whole world pixel, as in the texture. With smoothing off the whole picture
    jumps R pixels at a time, which is the stairstep.
  - with smoothing on, the remainder times R taken off the camera's offset, in
    screen pixels. That is the original's second camera, folded into the one
    camera (`camera`).
  - a scissor on the picture's rectangle (`clip`), because a texture clips what
    is drawn into it and a camera does not.
  - each rotated rect rasterised to the 160 by 90 grid (`runs`): a world pixel
    is covered when its centre is inside the rect, and a row of them is one
    `draw-rectangle` a pixel tall, which the camera scales to `R` screen
    pixels. So the slanted edges are chunky staircases, as in the nearest-
    filtered texture, and \"World resolution: 160x90\" is something you can count.

  Where this differs from the render-texture version. The GPU's rasteriser fills
  a pixel by its centre as well, but it breaks ties on an edge by its own rule
  and this breaks them by half-open intervals, so a cell whose centre is exactly
  on an edge can go either way. The overscan blit stretched the texture by
  different factors across and down (5.0625 and 5.111 at R = 5); a camera has one
  zoom, so this takes the larger (the height's), and the world overruns the
  window sideways by about 1.56 R, which the clip trims. That keeps the world
  covering the whole clip, so no strip of the clear colour shows at the bottom,
  while the pixels are about 1 percent wider on the glass than the horizontal
  stretch would make them. With overscan the zoom is not a whole number, so the
  virtual pixels are not all the same width on the glass, as in the original.
  The picture with overscan off is 160 by 90 at `R - 1` instead of at 4/5 of `R`:
  the two are the same at R = 5 (the original's), and `R - 1` stays a whole zoom
  at any R. The remainder is multiplied by `R`, as the original multiplies by
  RATIO, whatever the zoom the picture is drawn at, so with overscan on or off
  the slide is not exactly the world's remainder, just as in the original.

  Controls. S becomes a \"smooth\" button and O an \"overscan\" button, side by
  side below Back. A tap flips the one it ends on (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture`, so a press
  that began elsewhere and slid onto a button does nothing). Both read their
  state from the status line, which is the original's, without its \"(S / O
  toggle)\" hint. `get-time` and `get-frame-time` become the sum of
  `:delta-seconds`, unclamped as the original's is. The fps is the host's
  `GetFPS`, read every frame as Starfield shows it. The original's window size
  and `set-target-fps` have no phone counterpart: \"Screen resolution\" reports
  the window drawn here, 160R by 90R.

  The state holds numbers only: `:t` the seconds, `:rot` the degrees,
  `:smooth?`, `:overscan?`, `:screen` and the `:gesture`. Colours are `[r g b a]`
  vectors."
