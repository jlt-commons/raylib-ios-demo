  "Bouncing text particles you can throw, cut, shatter and glue. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `strings-management` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `strings-management`), which is raylib's
  `text_strings_management` example. A sentence is one particle, and every
  particle bounces round the arena losing a tenth of its speed at a wall and a
  hundredth to friction on every frame.

  The original is driven by a mouse and a keyboard, and each action has a touch
  replacement or is dropped:

  - Drag with the left button and release to throw: drag a particle and lift,
    and it flies off with the velocity of the last four `:down` frames. The
    release position is never read, because on the device it is whatever the
    hardware held last.
  - Right-click to cut in half: a long press on a particle cuts it in half.
  - SHIFT and right-click to shatter into characters: the \"shatter\" button arms
    a one-shot, and the next tap on a particle shatters it into single
    characters. It is armed until a particle is hit or the button is tapped
    again.
  - Middle-click to shake everything: the \"shake\" button.
  - CTRL while dragging one particle over another to glue them: release a
    dragged particle while it overlaps another and the two are glued, the
    dragged text first. Only a drag that left the tap slop glues, so a tap on
    two particles that happen to overlap does nothing, and only a slow drop
    glues, under 200 px a second scaled by `u`, so a particle thrown across
    another flies on instead of sticking. A glue that would make a
    particle wider than the arena, or pass the 100 particle cap, is refused.
  - Keys 1 to 6 to reset the sentence through a case transform: the \"case\"
    button steps through the six in the original's order, plain, upper, lower,
    Pascal, snake and camel. Its label names the one the next tap applies. The
    plain and lower sentences are the same text, as in the original.
  - Typing a character to split the lone particle on it is dropped. There is no
    keyboard, and a touch has no character to offer. See `dropped`.

  A tap under Back is ignored because it belongs to the host. A swipe is not
  checked against Back, as in the other swipe scenes, but nothing here reads one:
  a drag only takes hold of a particle where it is pressed, and the arena starts
  below Back, so a drag that starts under Back finds no particle.

  The string operations are the original's `subs`, `str` and `clojure.string`
  versions of raylib's TextSubtext, TextSplit and TextTo* helpers. Timing is
  `:delta-seconds`, clamped at 0 below and not above, as the original uses
  `get-frame-time` unclamped. Friction is applied once per frame, not per
  second, as the original does. Speeds are the original's pixels a second scaled
  by `u`, the geometric mean of the two axes against 800 by 450, since the
  motion is free in two dimensions. Randomness is an LCG whose high bits are
  used, so a scene replays.

  Deviations: the opening sentence is centred in the arena where the original
  starts its top-left corner at the window centre, which shoved it against the
  wall on its first frame. The text size is cut back until the widest of the
  six case sentences fits the arena width (UPPER is wider than the plain one), and the arena sits below Back and above the buttons in
  place of the whole window. A grabbed particle is held inside the arena. The
  hint is one line in place of six.

  Text is laid out in `dimensions` and in the particles' own sizes, both from an
  injected `measure` `(fn [s size] -> px)`. Unlike the other text scenes the
  particles' sizes live in the state, because the walls and the hit tests need
  them, so `advance` takes `measure` too: the host puts raylib's own text width
  on every input as `:measure`, and the tests pass an estimate to `scene`. A
  particle's width is measured when it is made and kept, so the draw method
  needs no cache. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
