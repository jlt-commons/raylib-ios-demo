  "A row of cubes each spinning in place with a phase offset, ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `spinning-cubes` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `spinning_cubes`) (zlib licence).

  The original looks from (0, 6, 10) at the origin through a 45 degree
  perspective camera, draws a grid of 12 and then five cubes of side 1 at
  x = -4, -2, 0, 2 and 4, height 0.5, coloured red, orange, green, blue and
  violet. Each sits in rlPushMatrix/rlPopMatrix after `rlTranslatef(x, 0.5, 0)`
  and `rlRotatef(angle, 0.3, 1, 0)`, where the angle is the frame number times 2
  plus 30 for each cube's index. Here that is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/compose` of
  `translate` and `rotate-axis` in the same order, so as in rlgl the turn
  applies to the cube first. The camera, the grid, the cubes, their colours and
  their shading (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/cube`'s default is raylib-jlt's `cube!`) are the
  original's. Nothing reads a frame time, like the original: the angle grows 2
  degrees an update.

  There is no input and so no control to map. The original's caption sits below
  Back, with the 3D view in the field under it, full width to the bottom. The
  view is `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`'s `[x y w h]` viewport on that field. The original's
  45 degree fovy is kept while the field is at least as wide as 800x450. In a
  narrower field `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` widens it so the original's
  horizontal view still fits, and the field shows more above and below. The
  grid reaches past the field's edges, so the draw method clips to the field.

  The camera never moves, so `grid-list` builds the grid once per layout and
  `scene-list` adds the cubes to it each frame. The state holds only `:frame`.
  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
