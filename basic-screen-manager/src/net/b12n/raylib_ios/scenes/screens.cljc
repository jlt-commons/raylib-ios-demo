  "A screen manager: LOGO, TITLE, GAMEPLAY, ENDING, each a flat colour and a
  label. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `basic-screen-manager` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `basic_screen_manager`), where ENTER steps to
  the next screen and a timer steps on its own. It differs from the other
  scenes in having nothing to draw but a state machine, so what it shows is the
  transition rule.

  A tap stands in for ENTER, and the timer is the original's: frame-locked, one
  step on every 90th frame counted from the start, about 1.5 s at 60 fps. The
  counter belongs to the scene and is never reset, so a tap does not postpone
  the next timed step, which is how the original behaves. ENDING steps back to
  LOGO, because the original takes `(mod (inc idx) 4)`.

  A tap and the timer on the same frame step once, because both only decide
  whether to step and the step itself happens once. When the timer fires with a
  touch already in progress, the touch is dropped by storing `gesture/idle`:
  that finger landed on a screen that has gone, and its lift would otherwise
  skip the new one before anyone had seen it. A press on the timer frame itself
  is kept, since it starts on the new screen and is an ordinary tap. A tap is judged at where the finger started, so one that
  starts under Back belongs to the host and steps nothing.

  Text is laid out in `dimensions`: the label and the hint are left-aligned, so
  no text is measured. Both are scaled by one factor from the original's 800 by
  450 window and placed below `gesture/back-region`."
