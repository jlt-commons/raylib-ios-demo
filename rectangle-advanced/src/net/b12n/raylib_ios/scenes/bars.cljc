  "Five bars, each rounded by a different amount on its left and right ends, each
  filled with a horizontal gradient. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `rectangle-advanced` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `rectangle_advanced`), itself raylib's `shapes_rectangle_advanced.c`.

  raylib has no call for this and the C example builds it from rlgl by hand, for
  the same reason everything else here reaches for rlgl: `DrawRectangleRounded`
  takes a Rectangle by value and accepts one roundness and one colour, and this
  wants two of each.

  The shape is a triangle fan from the centre over a walked outline. Each corner
  is a quarter arc at whatever radius its own side asked for, and the straight
  runs between them fall out of the same loop, so a roundness of 0 collapses to a
  right angle with no special case. That is the part worth keeping: one loop
  draws a square, a lozenge, and everything between.

  The gradient is free once the fan exists, because colour is interpolated per
  vertex from each point's own x. See `rounded` for the single-roundness version
  and `gradient` for the same per-vertex colouring on a plain quad."

  "The perimeter as [x y] points, walked clockwise from the top-left corner.

  Roundness is scaled against half the shorter dimension, so a fully rounded
  short bar becomes a lozenge rather than overshooting into itself. A corner
  whose radius is zero contributes `per`+1 identical points, which the fan
  renders as a right angle: degenerate triangles have no area and disappear,
  which is why no special case is needed."
