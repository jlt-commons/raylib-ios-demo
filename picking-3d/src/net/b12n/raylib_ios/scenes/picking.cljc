  "Tap a cube to pick it with a ray. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `picking-3d` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `picking_3d`),
  which is raylib's `core_3d_picking` example (zlib licence).

  The original looks at the point (0, 1, 0) through a 45 degree perspective
  camera that circles it at a height of 10 and a radius of 14. It draws a
  `DrawCube` of side 2 at (0, 1, 0) in GRAY with DARKGRAY wires, a grid of 10,
  and, once something is picked, the ray with `DrawRay`. A click casts
  `GetScreenToWorldRay` through the cursor and tests it with
  `GetRayCollisionBox`. A hit turns the cube RED with MAROON wires, adds a
  second set of GREEN wires 0.2 larger and shows \"BOX SELECTED\". A click
  while it is selected lets go instead, without casting, and the ray stays
  drawn. The projection is in software, by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d`, whose `screen->ray`
  and `ray-box` are those two raylib calls.

  The original's controls, and what stands in for each:
  - A click picks. A tap does, through the same `view` that draws the frame, so
    the ray starts at the camera that was drawn. It picks at the tap's PRESS
    position (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture/track`'s `:at`), never the release. A tap that
    ends a multi-finger touch picks nothing, and neither does a drag, because
    the gesture's slop is what separates them.
  - The camera circles by itself, 0.005 radians an update as the original's
    `orbit-frame` does. It stands still from a press until the finger is up,
    so a tap's ray is cast through the camera the finger saw.
  - Right click captured the pointer and gave the camera to the mouse and W, A,
    S and D. A one-finger drag stands for the mouse-look: it turns the camera
    round the cube, 0.004 radians a pixel (the original's `SENS`) times `800 /
    field width`, so the glass is as far to cross as the original's window.
    Dragging right turns the scene right. Dragging down raises the camera by
    the same distance in world units a pixel as the angle would sweep at the
    radius, held between `min-height` and `max-height`. The orbit keeps the
    radius and aims at (0, 1, 0), so the cube stays in view. The drag starts
    only once the finger is further than `gesture/slop` from its press, so a
    tap does not nudge the camera between press and release. It starts only on
    its own fresh press inside the field, a second finger ends it, and the
    finger that stays never takes it back.
  - Dropped: the cursor lock, its right-click toggle, the hint that names it,
    and W, A, S and D, which walked the free camera. There is no free camera
    here, only the orbit.

  The readout keeps the original's \"BOX SELECTED\" and adds the hit's distance,
  point and normal from `ray-box`, in the top left of the field. A miss says
  \"missed\". The text is in `dimensions`. The hint takes the original's top line
  to the caption row below Back and the bottom hint is dropped with the lock.

  The ray is drawn with `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/lines` from the camera, 10000 units
  along its direction as `DrawRay` does, clipped at the near plane. From the
  camera that cast it, it is seen end-on: a single point at the tapped pixel,
  which is correct and also invisible until the camera moves on. The lines are
  drawn after every face and there is no depth buffer, so `ray-pieces` cuts the
  stretch inside the cube out of the ray, split at the ray's entry and exit.
  What is left of the ray behind the cube can still show through it from some
  angles.

  A face with a corner behind the near plane is dropped whole. The original's
  fovy is kept while the field is as wide as 800x450 and widened by
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.soft3d/fit-camera` in a narrower one. The wires hide the edges of
  their own cube that face away (`{:hide-back? true}`), the larger green set as
  well.

  The state holds `:angle` and `:height` (the camera), `:ray`, `:pick` (the
  `ray-box` result, nil when nothing is shown), `:hit?` (selected), `:orbit`
  (the drag's `:start`, `:at` and `:dragging?`, or nil), `:gesture`, `:n` (the
  finger count last frame) and `:screen`. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
