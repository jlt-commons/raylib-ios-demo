(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.clock
  "A seven-segment clock, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `digital-clock` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `digital_clock`).

  Each digit is seven rectangles, and which of them are lit comes from a table
  with one entry per numeral. Unlit segments are drawn too, dimly, because that
  is what a real seven-segment display looks like and because leaving them out
  makes a 1 look like it is floating.

  The layout is derived from the screen rather than the original's fixed pixel
  columns, and stacked as HH / MM / SS rather than run across in one row: six
  digits side by side on a portrait phone leaves each one about 90 pixels wide,
  which is smaller than the clock in the status bar directly above it.

  The colon between rows blinks on even seconds, which is the one piece of
  state a clock face has that is not the time."

;; a top, b top-right, c bottom-right, d bottom, e bottom-left, f top-left,
;; g middle. The usual naming, clockwise from the top with the middle last.
