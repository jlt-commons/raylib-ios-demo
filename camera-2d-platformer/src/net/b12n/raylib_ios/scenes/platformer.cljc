(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.platformer
  "A 2D platformer with five ways for the camera to follow the player. Ported
  from raylib-jolt-demo's `camera-2d-platformer` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `camera-2d-platformer`), which is raylib's
  `core_2d_camera_platformer` example (zlib licence).

  The original has a red 40 by 40 player, a sky and a floor and three one-way
  platforms. The arrow keys walk at 200 units a second, SPACE jumps at 350
  while standing on something, gravity is 400, C cycles the camera through
  five modes and R puts the player and camera back. The world, the physics and
  the five modes are the original's, and the physics use `:delta-seconds` as it
  uses `get-frame-time`, with no clamp: the collision test only asks whether
  this frame's fall crosses a top edge, so a long stalled frame (checked at 0.1
  s) still lands and nothing tunnels.

  Controls here are five buttons along the bottom, read from the input's
  `:touch-points` so two can be held at once, as in `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.asteroids`:
  - \"<\" and \">\" walk left and right while held, in place of the arrows
    (the default font has no triangle glyphs). Both held cancel out, as both
    arrows did.
  - \"jump\" jumps while held and standing, in place of SPACE, which the
    original reads with `key-down?` too, so holding it hops again on landing.
  - \"camera\" steps to the next mode on a press, in place of C.
  - \"reset\" restores the player and camera on a press, in place of R. The
    mode is kept, as in the original.
  A press is a button that was not held on the frame before, so holding
  neither repeats nor re-fires, and a finger that slides on from another
  button counts. The original's key-help line is dropped, since the buttons
  name themselves, and a line above the field names the mode instead.

  The original's 800x450 view is fitted into the field between that line and
  the buttons by one base zoom, the smaller of the two axis scales, and it is
  the camera's zoom. Every mode's `W` and `H` becomes the field's own width
  and height in pixels after that zoom, so the camera's offset is the field's
  centre, the clamped mode tests the map's corners against the field's edges
  (through `net.b12n.raylib-ios.camera2d/world->screen`) and the push mode's dead zone is
  the middle 60 percent of the field. Distances in world units (the smooth
  mode's 10 unit rest and 30 unit floor, the even-out mode's 1 unit snap) are
  unchanged. The camera's offset is kept in the field's own pixels, and
  `camera` moves it to scene pixels. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
