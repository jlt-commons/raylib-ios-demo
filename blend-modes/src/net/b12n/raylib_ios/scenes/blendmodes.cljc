  "Blend Modes, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `blend-modes` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `blend_modes`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/blend_modes.clj, zlib licence): a cluster of three
  coloured glows drawn over a night skyline through each of four blend modes in
  turn.

  What is the original's:
  - The modes and their order (lines 28-31): ALPHA, ADDITIVE, MULTIPLIED and
    ADD_COLORS, which are raylib.h's `BlendMode` values 0, 1, 2 and 3. The
    skyline is drawn plainly, then the glow between `BeginBlendMode` and
    `EndBlendMode` (lines 106-115).
  - The picture: 800 by 450 units, drawn from two 400 by 225 textures stretched
    to it, so a texture pixel is 2 units (lines 24-27, 106-114).
  - The clear colour, RAYWHITE, and the GRAY text (lines 105, 116-125).

  The two textures are procedural (`sky-pixel`, lines 44-66, and `glow-pixel`,
  lines 73-87), and there is no texture here, so each is redrawn as shapes:
  - The sky is one vertical gradient quad from (18, 12, 42) to (58, 24, 74), the
    ends of `lerp` (lines 48-51; the original truncates each channel to an int
    per row, so its gradient steps where this one is smooth).
  - The buildings are one rect a column of 22 texture pixels, from `top` down:
    `top` is `horizon + int(span * 0.5 * hash01(col))` with `horizon` 153 (lines
    52-57), in (14, 10, 22). `hash01` is the original's (lines 37-41), so the
    skyline is the same one.
  - The windows (line 61) are lit where `lx` is 5 to 17, `(quot (- y top) 10) +
    (quot lx 6)` is a multiple of 3, and `hash01(col * 977 + quot y 10)` is
    under 0.4. Those depend only on the row band and on which sixth of the
    column `lx` is in, so each is a rect, a run of rows by one of the three
    spans of `lx` (5, 6 to 11, 12 to 17). `emit-windows!` is every such rect, and
    a test rasterises the buildings and windows and compares all 90000 pixels with
    the original's rule.
  - Each glow is a triangle fan of 16 triangles, its centre (r, g, b, 255) and
    its rim (0, 0, 0, 0). A colour interpolated linearly across a fan is `k *
    colour` with `k = 1 - d / radius`, which is the original's `k * br`, `k * 255`
    (lines 80-86) to within the fan's 16-sided edge. A base quad of (0, 0, 0, 0)
    is drawn first, over the whole picture, as the texture is transparent black
    outside the blobs.

  Deviations, all in the glow: the original sums the three blobs into the
  texture and blends once, where here each blob is blended on its own, so where
  two glows overlap the picture differs: under ADDITIVE two equal glows overlap
  about half as bright as the original's, since the summed texture's cross
  terms are lost, ALPHA and MULTIPLIED differ there too, and ADD_COLORS, which
  only adds, is the same. The fan has 16 sides, not a circle. Under MULTIPLIED, rlgl's
  `glBlendFunc(GL_DST_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)` leaves a pixel alone where
  the source is (0, 0, 0, 0), so the original's note that MULTIPLIED blackens
  everything the blobs do not reach is not what the equation gives: the base
  quad changes nothing in any of the four modes, and is kept because the
  texture it stands for covers the rect.

  Controls: a tap anywhere outside Back, in place of SPACE, moves to the next
  mode. The tap is by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture`, so it is where the finger started. The
  texts go above the picture, not on it at (300, 350) and (W / 2 - 60, 370) at
  size 10, since size 10 is too small to read on a phone; the second still names
  the mode.

  The picture is the largest 16:9 that fits below the texts, centred. The draw
  method draws the glow through `call-blended!`, which ends the blend mode in a
  `finally`, so a failed draw cannot leave a later scene blending."
