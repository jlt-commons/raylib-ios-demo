(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.logoanim
  "raylib's logo assembling itself, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `logo-anim` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `logo_anim`), which
  ports raylib's own shapes_logo_raylib_anim.c.

  A square blinks, the top and left bars grow out of it, the bottom and right
  close the frame, the letters arrive one at a time, and the whole thing fades.
  Then it starts again, which is the one change from the original: that has R to
  replay and this has no keyboard, so it loops.

  Nothing here is eased, and that is deliberate rather than lazy. Every stage
  advances by a fixed step per frame and changes when a counter hits an exact
  value, which is why it feels mechanical. The original reads that way and it is
  worth keeping, since the point of the piece is the assembly and not the
  motion.

  The logo is 256 units square with a 16-unit border in raylib's own source. Both
  are scaled to the screen here, so the proportions survive on a phone."
