  "Particles Blending, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `particles-blending` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `particles_blending`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/particles_blending.clj, zlib licence): a pool of 200
  coloured sparks that fall and fade, drawn with alpha blending or additive
  blending.

  What is the original's:
  - The pool (lines 17-21, 35-44): 200 particles, each drawn once from the LCG as
    r, g, b in 0 to 255 and a size of `GetRandomValue(1, 30) / 20`, in that order.
    A particle keeps its colour and size for life. `GetRandomValue` is the
    project's LCG seeded with 20261002, taking its high bits, so every run opens
    the same.
  - `activate-first-inactive` (lines 46-55): the first inactive particle in the
    pool is activated at the emitter, with alpha 1.0. A full pool activates
    nothing.
  - `update-particle` (lines 57-64): every active particle loses 0.005 of alpha,
    goes inactive when that leaves 0.0 or less, and otherwise falls `GRAVITY / 2`
    of 1.5 units. The spawn comes first, so a new particle also ages that frame.
  - The sprite (lines 84-89): `SPARK-SIZE` of 32 times `size`, drawn centred on
    the particle, tinted `(r, g, b, int(255 * alpha))`.
  - The blend (lines 81, 90) and the clear, DARKGRAY (line 80). The texts (lines
    91-103) are BLACK \"PRESS SPACE to CHANGE BLENDING MODE\" at (150, 20) and,
    at (290, H - 40), BLACK \"ALPHA BLENDING\" or, at (280, H - 40), RAYWHITE
    \"ADDITIVE BLENDING\", all at size 20.

  The sprite is a texture the original makes by hand (`spark-pixel`, lines
  23-33, a white dot whose alpha is `(1 - d / r)` squared) and there is no
  texture here, so each particle is a flat circle of the sprite's size, the
  tint's alpha on its whole disc. A circle blended additively saturates faster
  than the soft dot, and the original's per-pixel falloff is gone; the size, the
  colour and the alpha are the original's.

  Controls: a finger held in the field is the emitter, in place of the mouse, one
  particle a frame at the finger. The original activates one a frame at the mouse
  wherever it is, so a pool is always filling; here nothing is emitted with no
  finger down. A finger belongs to the control it began on: one that began in Back
  or on the button never emits wherever it slides, and one that began in the field
  stops while it is over the button. A tap on the button flips alpha and additive,
  in place of SPACE. The tap is by `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture`, so it is where the finger
  started, and the flip is on its release frame.

  Units. The original's window is 800 by 450. The particles move in its units
  (the physics above is unchanged), but the window is 800 wide and `(h - top) /
  u` tall, where `u` is the safe region's width over 800 and `top` is the bottom
  of Back, so a circle is round on a phone and a portrait field is taller than
  450 units. The original's second text sits at `H - 40` and the button sits
  under it, its bottom 20 units above the screen's. The top text is centred
  rather than at x 150, and cut back to fit.

  The state holds numbers in mutable arrays: `:xs :ys :alphas` (doubles), `:acts`
  (1 for active) and the colours `:rs :gs :bs` and `:sizes`, the `:blending`
  (0 alpha, 1 additive), the `:gesture` and the `:screen`.
  `advance` updates the arrays IN PLACE and returns the state, so a state is not
  a value to keep across `advance`. `particle` is the allocating accessor for
  tests. The draw method draws through `call-blended!`, which ends the blend mode
  in a `finally`, so a failed draw cannot leave a later scene blending."
