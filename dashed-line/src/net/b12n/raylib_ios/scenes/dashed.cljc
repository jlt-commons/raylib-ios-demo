  "A dashed line from the centre to your finger, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `dashed-line` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `dashed_line`).

  raylib has no dashed-line call, so a dash is every other segment of a line
  chopped into equal pieces. Walking the unit vector rather than interpolating
  between endpoints keeps the dashes a constant length however far the finger
  is, which is the property that makes it read as a dashed line rather than a
  line with a varying pattern.

  Touch rather than mouse, and it drifts when nothing is touching, for the same
  reasons as the collision scene beside it."
