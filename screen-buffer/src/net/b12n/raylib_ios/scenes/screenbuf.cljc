  "Screen Buffer, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `screen-buffer` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `screen_buffer`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/screen_buffer.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_screen_buffer`: the classic DOS fire as a software screen buffer. A
  100 by 56 grid of palette indices is simulated, blitted through a 256-colour
  flame palette into a texture and drawn scaled up.
  The raylib C example it follows is zlib licensed, and this is an altered
  version of that too.

  Mirrored from screen_buffer.clj:
  - MAX-COLORS 256 (lines 21-26). The grid size is not mirrored, see below.
  - `hsv->color` and PALETTE (lines 28-53): `hsv->colour` and `palette`. Entry
    `i` has `t = i / 255` and hue `250 + 150 t^2`, with saturation and value both
    `t`, so the low indices stay dark.
  - `grow-roots` (lines 55-60): each root from column 2 on gains 0 to 2 a step,
    capped at 255; columns 0 and 1 stay put.
  - `seed-and-clear` (lines 62-69): the roots are copied into the bottom row and
    the top row is blanked.
  - `rise` (lines 71-96): a lit cell clears itself, drifts one column by
    `GetRandomValue(0, 2) - 1`, and if the new column is in 1..199 lands one row
    up, losing `GetRandomValue(0, 3)` (but never below 0). A cell whose new column
    falls outside vanishes. Rows go in ascending order from row 1.
  - The picture (lines 98-126): the whole grid, drawn as one scaled texture with
    nothing else on screen.

  Deviations. The randomness comes from the project LCG, seeded in the state, in
  place of GetRandomValue, so a seed always replays the same fire. Every call
  keeps the original's order and range, one for each root from column 2 and then
  one for the drift and one for the decay of each lit cell that stays inside.

  The grid. The original's is 200 by 112 (raylib's C example's is 400 by 225);
  this one is 100 by 56, a quarter of the cells. The rules are the same, so the
  flame is relatively taller (the decay per row is unchanged) and each cell is
  twice as wide on the screen.

  The step rate. The original runs the whole simulation and rewrites every texel
  each frame. Under laptop jolt one whole step on this grid is about 0.47 ms and
  a whole upload about 0.7 ms, which the phone, about 33 times slower, cannot pay
  in a frame. So both go a band at a time, on one schedule. Each frame steps and
  uploads `band-rows` (8) rows, top to bottom, and a sweep of `period` (7) frames
  is exactly one of the original's steps: the roots grow and the bottom and top
  rows are set on the first band, then the rest rise in the original's ascending
  order. So the fire follows the original's rules but runs `period` times slower,
  60 / 7, about 8.6 steps a second at 60 frames a second against the original's
  60. Measured on a laptop under jolt, a frame (the step of its band plus the
  upload of the band and the row above) took 0.19 ms on average and 0.29 ms at
  the 99th percentile, with an occasional 2 ms frame when the collector ran. A
  band's upload also takes the row above it, because that is where the band's
  cells land. Rows below the band are older than rows above it by up to `period`
  frames, so a moving seam between fresher and older rows can show.

  The hot start. The original's roots start at 0 and grow by 0 to 2 a step, so
  at 60 steps a second the fire takes a few seconds to light. At 8.6 steps a
  second a cold fire would take about 30 s to light (an estimate from the step
  rate, not a measurement: the roots grow a mean of 1 a step, so 255 / 8.57 steps
  a second). That is long to watch a dark screen, so the roots start hot: from
  column 2 on each is a random 192 to 255 (one LCG draw each), and columns 0 and
  1 stay dark as they do in the original. The first sweep already has a flame.

  Entering the scene fills all 5600 texels once, a one-off cost.

  The picture is the 100 by 56 grid scaled to the widest size the free area
  allows, below Back, with nearest-neighbour filtering. The original's window
  title is the only text, so there is none. The state holds `:frame`, `:seed`,
  `:roots`, `:buf`, `:stepped` (the band the last frame stepped, which the draw uploads) and `:screen`."
