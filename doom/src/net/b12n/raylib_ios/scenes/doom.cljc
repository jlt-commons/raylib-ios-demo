  "A Doom-style ray caster you walk and shoot in on two thumbs, ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `doom` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `doom`) (`doom.clj`, 613 lines), which is Michiel Borkent's
  (@borkdude) `examples/doom.clj` in babashka/ffi (MIT licence, see NOTICE),
  itself the technique Wolfenstein made famous: one ray per screen column, a
  DDA walk over a grid of characters, and the distance of the hit decides how
  tall that column's strip is. The projection and the rects are
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.doom.ray`, the level and the colours `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.doom.map`,
  the HUD, minimap and crosshair `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.doom.hud`. This namespace is the
  game: the state, the rules, the fingers and the layout.

  Mirrored from doom.clj, by line:
  - The level (lines 51-67), the start (2.5, 7.5) facing +x with a camera plane
    of 0.66 (lines 154-175), and the six imps (line 152).
  - The DDA, its perpendicular distance and the wall height `H / dist` (lines
    181-219, 234-252), the distance and side shade (lines 221-226), the z-buffer
    and the sprite pass with its 12 strips tested against it (lines 177, 271-326).
  - `rotate` (lines 328-338), `move` at 3.4 cells a second, sliding along walls by
    testing each axis alone (lines 340-351), `shoot` taking the nearest living
    imp inside a 0.985 cone (lines 353-373), the imps walking at 0.9 and biting
    within 0.9 for a point of health a frame each (lines 375-405), the muzzle
    flash of 0.06 seconds, the fps averaged over 0.4 seconds, and `dt` held to
    0.05 (lines 430-450). The order of a frame is the original's: look, move,
    shoot, imps, flash, fps.
  - The HUD (lines 526-562): HEALTH red under 40, KILLS, IMPS, SHOTS, the fps and
    the column count, the crosshair, YOU DIED; the minimap (lines 469-499) with
    its panel, a rect for each wall in its style's colour, a dot for each living
    imp, the player and a line along the heading. All at the original's 900 by
    560 window's positions, scaled to the view.

  Changed, and why:
  - **Columns: 180, the original's 450.** The phone runs scene code about 33
    times slower than jolt on the laptop, and on the laptop a frame has to take
    about 0.30 ms under jolt (the update, the build and the draw side's loops
    with the FFI stubbed) to hold 60 fps. That 0.30 is empirical, from the
    2026-10-03 device pass, and not 16.7 ms divided by 33, which is 0.50. 180 is the largest of the counts
    measured (100, 160, 180 and 200) whose worst pose fits. At
    1206 pixels wide a column is 6.7 pixels, where the original's 450 are 2.7.
    Measured under jolt on the laptop: 0.20 ms from the start, 0.29 ms at the
    worst of 2576 poses (each open cell's centre by 16 headings, with and without
    six imps in view) and 0.28 ms at the worst of 1500 random poses with both
    thumbs held and the flash on. At 100 columns the worst was 0.20 ms, at 160
    0.27 ms and at 200 0.31 ms.
  - **Flat strips for textured ones.** A wall column is one rect in its style's
    colour (the original's own minimap colours) times the original's shade, as the
    vertex colour multiplies the texel. The brick, stone, panel and circuit
    patterns, and the texture coordinate, are dropped. A run of columns that are
    the same rect in pixels is one rect, which draws what the columns did.
  - **Sprites as rects.** The imp is cut into the original's 12 strips, each tested
    against its middle column's wall. A strip draws the body, head and eyes its
    texel column shows, as up to three rects, instead of a texture.
  - **The picture keeps the original's 900 by 560 proportions**, which are not
    square pixels, scaled to the field's width and placed at its top. On a phone
    held upright the rest of the field is the thumbs' ground.

  Controls. The original's keys and mouse and what stands in for each:
  - W, A, S, D and the arrows: a relative thumb-stick (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick`) that begins
    on a fresh press in the left half, in the lower half of the field. The press
    point is its centre, past `gesture/slop` from it the player moves that way,
    up the glass forward, as W and D would, through `move`. The stick is a unit
    vector, so one speed everywhere, where the original's keys add. The strafe
    is the original's, along the camera plane, so it is 0.66 of the forward speed.
  - The mouse delta and LEFT and RIGHT: a drag in the right half turns, 0.0022
    radians a pixel (line 413) times `900 / view width`, a drag right turning right.
  - Left click and SPACE: a finger that lands on the FIRE button fires, once for
    each landing, as `mouse-pressed?` and `key-pressed?` do. It works while the
    other thumb walks. A finger on the button never starts a stick or a turn.
  - A stick and a turn begin only on a fresh finger and follow only their own,
    by touch id, so a resting finger never steers (`net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick`).
  - Dropped: `hide-cursor`, `set-mouse-position` and `show-cursor` (lines 410-420,
    the cursor warp), the quit key, and the title and window.

  The state holds the original's keys (`:pos-x :pos-y :dir-x :dir-y :plane-x
  :plane-y :imps :health :kills :shots :flash :fps :fps-frames :fps-elapsed`) and
  the fingers: `:look`, `:stick`, `:n`, `:pts`, `:ids` and `:screen`. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors, and the rect buffer's are packed as `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/rgba`."
