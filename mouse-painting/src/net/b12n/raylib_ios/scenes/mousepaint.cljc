  "Mouse Painting, ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `mouse-painting` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `mouse_painting`)
  (net/b12n/raylib_jlt/mouse_painting.clj, EPL 2.0), which is raylib's
  `textures_mouse_painting` (zlib). This is an altered version of both.

  A paint program on a render target that keeps its paint between frames. The
  canvas is drawn into only when a finger paints, and drawn back every frame.

  Mirrored from mouse_painting.clj:
  - The palette (lines 15-24): `palette`, the 23 raylib named colours in the
    original's order, and `color-count` 23. Swatch 0 is RAYWHITE and is both the
    canvas's background and the eraser's colour.
  - The brush (line 54, 62): it starts at 20 and moves in steps of 5 between 2
    and 50, clamped, as the wheel does.
  - Painting (lines 79-84): a filled circle of the brush's radius in the
    selected colour at the pointer, only below the panel. Erasing (lines 63-67)
    paints with swatch 0 instead, and the preview of an eraser is a GRAY circle
    outline (lines 99-107).
  - The clear (lines 76-77): C fills the canvas with swatch 0.
  - The panel (lines 109-141): a strip of swatches with a black outline round
    the selected one, over a LIGHTGRAY rule.

  Inputs. The mouse becomes touch. A finger that lands in the field paints, and
  keeps painting while it stays down and inside the field; a finger that lands
  anywhere else, or slides in from outside, never paints, so a touch already
  down when the scene opens leaves no mark. Four buttons replace the keys and
  the wheel: SIZE - and SIZE + (the wheel), ERASER (the right button, as a
  toggle) and CLEAR (C). A tap on a swatch picks it and also turns the eraser
  off. Each fires on a press and none lies under Back.

  Deviations.
  - **Segments.** The original draws one circle at the pointer a frame, and a
    mouse moves a few pixels in one. A finger moves far more, so a stroke is
    the segment from the last point to this one, drawn as circles spaced half a
    radius apart (`stroke-points`), at most `max-circles` of them. The first
    point of a touch is a single circle, as in the original.
  - **Dropped.** The SAVE button and the S key (a screenshot), its banner, and
    the swatch hover highlight, which a finger has no use for.
  - **Palette.** The swatches wrap to two rows when 23 would be under 70 pixels
    wide, so a thumb can hit them.
  - **A turn clears the canvas.** The canvas is the size of the field, so on a
    rotation it is made again, and made again it is empty: the state emits a
    clear, and the picture is lost. The original's window never turns.
  - **Layout.** The field is the safe region below the panel and buttons, to the
    edges, where the original's canvas is the whole window under its panel.

  The state holds `:marks`, what to draw into the canvas THIS frame and nothing
  older: `[:stroke x0 y0 x1 y1 radius colour]` or `[:clear colour]`, in the
  canvas's own pixels. Each update starts it empty again. Colours are
  `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
