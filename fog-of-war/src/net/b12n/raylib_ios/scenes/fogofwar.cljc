(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.fogofwar
  "A tile map under a fog that lifts where you walk. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's
  `fog-of-war` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `fog-of-war`) (`src/net/b12n/raylib_jlt/fog_of_war.clj`), itself a port of
  raylib's `textures_fog_of_war` (zlib licence).

  The original is a 25 by 15 map of 32 unit tiles (fog_of_war.clj lines 25-27,
  800 by 480 in all, drawn in an 800 by 450 window), two shades of blue picked
  at random per tile (line 73), with a 16 unit RED player (lines 28 and 127).
  Each frame every lit tile drops to remembered (`age-fog`, lines 47-51), then
  the tiles around the player's tile go lit (`light-around`, lines 53-63). The
  player's tile is `(int (/ (+ x 16) 32))` (`tile-of`, lines 42-45). The loops
  there run over `(range (- t 2) (+ t 2))`, which is t-2 to t+1: four tiles a
  side with one more behind than ahead, kept as it is. An unexplored tile is
  black, a remembered one is black at alpha 204 in the texture, which it stores as 163, a lit one is clear (lines
  104-112), and the text, at (10, 10) and 25 above the window's bottom, is drawn
  last in RAYWHITE (lines 139-148).

  The original draws the fog into a render texture ONE PIXEL PER TILE and
  stretches it over the map, so the bilinear filter softens the edges. That
  texture is not bound here. Each tile is instead one quad, in the
  vertex order of `net.b12n.raylib-ios.host/draw-gradient-quad`, whose four corners carry an alpha, and a
  corner's alpha is the mean of the four tiles that meet at it
  (`corner-alpha`), rounded to a whole alpha. Off the map's edge the texture's
  CLAMP wrap repeats the edge tile, so a corner on the border averages the tiles
  it has and a map corner takes its one tile. The difference from the texture is
  half a tile: bilinear filtering is exact at tile CENTRES and blends from
  centre to centre, where the quads are exact at tile CORNERS and blend across
  each tile. A lit tile among dark ones therefore fades out within its own
  square in the original and across the corners around it here, so the clear
  patch looks about half a tile smaller at its edge. Each quad is two
  triangles sharing the top-left to bottom-right edge, so it blends linearly
  across each triangle where a texture blends bilinearly; the two differ only
  where a tile's corners form a saddle. The remembered alpha is 163, not the 204
  the original draws (see `tile-alpha`). `emit-fog!` hands all the quads to the
  draw method as one batch of triangles, on the same whole-pixel tile edges as
  the tile fills, so they cover them exactly.

  The original's keys, and what stands in for each:
  - The four arrow keys add and subtract SPEED 5 a frame on x and y (lines
    86-87), each axis on its own, so its diagonal moves 5 on both. A relative
    thumb-stick replaces them, as `net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.boxcollide` does: the press is
    the centre, an axis is on when the finger is further than `gesture/slop`
    from it along that axis, and a diagonal scales both by 1 / sqrt 2
    (`diagonal`) so the stick moves at one speed. That is the one deliberate
    difference. `net.b12n.raylib-ios.stick` decides whose finger it is, by touch id, so a
    finger that was down when the scene opened, or began under Back, never
    steers, and a rotation drops the stick. A tap moves nothing.
  - The player is held to the map, 0 to 784 and 0 to 464 (lines 89-93).
  - Until the first move the player walks the original's patrol loop (`patrol`,
    lines 32-40) so the fog lifts by itself, and `steered?` ends it for good
    (line 88).

  Nothing reads a frame time, like the original: a frame is one update. The map
  is drawn whole at one scale, the largest that fits below Back, so the strip of
  the bottom row that the original's 450 high window cuts off is shown here. The
  text keeps its place on the map: the tile line 10 units in, the hint 425 down.
  The hint says \"DRAG to move\" where the original says \"ARROW KEYS to move\",
  and \"patrolling until you drag to steer\" where it says \"patrolling until you
  press an arrow key\".

  The state holds `:px` `:py`, `:fog` (375 numbers, 0 unexplored, 2 remembered,
  1 lit), `:tiles` (375 shades, 0 or 1), `:frame`, `:steered?`, `:stick` (the
  centre, the finger and the id, or nil), `:n`, `:pts` and `:ids` (the fingers of
  the last frame) and `:screen`. The tile shades are the project's LCG's high
  bits. Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors."
