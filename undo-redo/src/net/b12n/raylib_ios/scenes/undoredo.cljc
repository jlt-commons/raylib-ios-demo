(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.undoredo
  "A square driven round a grid with a bounded undo history. Ported from
  raylib-jolt-demo's `undo-redo` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `undo-redo`), which is raylib's `core_undo_redo` example.

  The original drives the square with the arrow keys, recolours it with SPACE
  and steps through the history with CTRL-Z and CTRL-Y. Here a `:swipe` from
  `net.b12n.raylib-ios.gesture` moves the square one cell in place of an arrow, a `:tap` on
  the square or anywhere else in the field recolours it in place of SPACE, and
  two buttons along the bottom, \"undo\" and \"redo\", replace CTRL-Z and CTRL-Y.
  A tap on a button does only the button's job and never also recolours, as the
  original's CTRL stops an arrow or SPACE from acting. A tap under Back is
  ignored, because it belongs to the host. A swipe is not checked against Back,
  as in the other swipe scenes, so one that starts there still moves the square.

  The rules are the original's. The grid is 30 by 13 cells and is not turned
  with the screen, because the history strip already needs the width. The
  history holds at most `max-states` (26) states, the original's slot count,
  as a vector and a cursor in place of its ring buffer. Recording past the cap
  drops the oldest state. Recording after an undo drops the states ahead of the
  cursor, so redo is empty after a new action, and undo and redo stop at the
  ends. A colour change counts as an action like a move, and a move into a wall
  is clamped to the grid and so records nothing.

  Timing is frame-locked, as the original is. It compares the square with the
  state at the cursor only every second frame, so `:ticks` counts frames and the
  comparison runs on every `sample-frames`th one. A change made and then undone
  inside one sample is therefore never recorded, as in the original. An undo or
  redo frame adopts the state at the cursor and discards that frame's own
  change, the original's order.

  The original's palette cycles in order, which is kept. The trail is every state
  up to the cursor, so an undo visibly shortens it, and the strip along the
  bottom has one slot per held state with the cursor's filled. The original
  puts the word and the count on one line beside the strip. Here the line
  sits above the strip so the strip can use the whole width.

  Everything lives below `gesture/back-region`. Text is laid out in
  `dimensions`, which takes an injected `measure` `(fn [s size] -> px)`: the
  draw method passes raylib's own text width and the tests pass an estimate.
  Colours are `[r g b a]` vectors, so the namespace stays pure."
