(ns net.b12n.raylib-ios.scenes.particles
  "Particles that pour out of your fingertip: water falls, smoke rises and
  fades, fire shrinks from yellow to red. Ported from raylib-jolt-demo's `particles` demo (originally raylib-jlt's `particles`).

  The original emits at the mouse all the time and cycles the type with
  LEFT/RIGHT. A finger has no hover, so emission happens only while one is on
  the glass (`:press` or `:down`), at the finger. Nothing is emitted on
  `:release`, whose position is the last hardware value and on a device is not
  the touch that just ended. The type changes when a `:press` lands inside the
  info box. Three types cycle, so the box only goes forward.

  The original's Fade and ColorLerp are packed-int arithmetic. Here a colour is
  an `[r g b a]` vector and the lerp and fade work on the channels, so the
  namespace stays pure and the draw method packs the result with `rl/rgba`.

  Sizes and speeds are the original's, written for an 800x450 window and scaled
  by `(min w h) / 450`. Randomness is the project LCG, taking the high bits.")

;; A plain def, so it can be changed over the nREPL and take effect on the next

;; smoke, lasts 1.8 s or about 108 frames, which is 324 live; 600 leaves room
;; for the tall phone, where water takes longer to leave the screen. Tune it on
;; the device.
